Sets up unlimited dashboards, AB tests, AI session replay, etc\n\n\n\nI'm a former PM who led product redesign and had a constant analytics hangover, and now a solo founder who only has time either to ship a new product or recruit users. Analytics is always lagging behind and piles up into an annoying debt.\n\n  \nI also was reflecting on product management as a job in general and was thinking about hard skills, and came to a conclusion that that is the only hard skill of a PM, and analytics is essentially the coding of the PM.\n\nGiven the AI and MCP boom, I figured it's possible to automate even that. So I built [UserWatch](https://userwatch.xyz/?utm_source=reddit): an AI product analyst that connects to PostHog and sets everything up for you.

    "title": "Why does every startup think they need enterprise software when they have 12 customers?I WILL NOT PROMOTE",
    "selftext": "Company has 15 employees and 12 paying customers. Revenue maybe $8k/month. CEO goes we need to implement Salesforce for our CRM. I'm like why? You have 12 customers, you could manage them with a notebook. But no. They spend 3 months evaluating enterprise platforms, hire implementation consultants, train the whole team on software that has 400 features they'll never use.\n\nSix months later they're paying $3,600/year for something that a $15/month tool would've handled perfectly.\n\nReal example from last year marketing agency, 8 employees, maybe 20 active clients.\n\nThey needed enterprise project management software. Looked at Monday, Asana Business, even considered custom development. I asked what's wrong with a shared Google sheet?\n\n\"We need something scalable! Professional! Enterprise-grade!\" Enterprise-grade for 20 projects? Really?\n\nThey spent $8k on software licensing and setup. I checked back 6 months later - they were using maybe 10% of the features and half the team had gone back to email for project updates.\n\nMeanwhile their competitor manages 50+ clients with Trello and seems way more organized. The pattern is always the same\n\nStartup sees successful big company using Enterprise Thing Assumes Enterprise Thing is why big company succeeded Buys Enterprise Thing despite being 1/100th the size Discovers Enterprise Thing is overkill and confusing Goes back to simple tools but keeps paying for Enterprise Thing\n\nIt's like a 5-person company buying an 18-wheeler to deliver pizza. The psychology is weird too. Simple tools feel unprofessional even when they work perfectly. Google Sheets = amateur Salesforce = serious business. But Google Sheets might actually be better for a 12-customer company. Easier to use, faster to set up, everyone already knows how it works.\n\nI learned this the hard way with clients' businesses. They try to use professional tools from day one. HubSpot for 3 leads per month. Slack for a 2-person team. Advanced analytics for a website with 100 monthly visitors. They spend more time configuring software than talking to actual customers.\n\nNow I tell early-stage companies start with the simplest tool that works, upgrade only when you're actually hitting limits. Need customer tracking? Start with Google Sheets Need project management? Try Trello first Need team communication? Maybe just text each other\n\nBoring advice but it works. Save the enterprise stuff for when you're actually enterprise-sized.\n\nHere's my rule: if your monthly software costs are higher than your monthly revenue, you're doing it wrong. Most startups could run their entire operation with $200/month in tools. Instead they're spending $2,000/month trying to look like Google.\n\nDont do it ",

      "Its their call and its their management responsibility to find tool or tools that would work for them. I agree - most of startups dont need enterprise grade software, true.

Was a mess. \n\nNow I build startup. First problem I found and this can be monetarized actually, I just dont have cycles from another startup - is that as founder I have to think which software to use and why. \n\nSo this alone took time and I have clear standards now - from communication to PM to documentation. Everything is clear and clean. Its is almost free. I have to pay for Teams Business Essential as was not able to find free product for over 1 hour calls.",
      "It's the same bullshit when software startups try to massively over-provision their services to scale to a billion users - but they don't even have any customers yet.\n\nAlmost nobody is running at the scale of companies like Google, but it's become trendy to duplicate their tech stack and spin up key-value databases running in the cloud that are optimized to serve half the planet. When their needs would be handled perfectly well with a simple MySQL database running on a single machine.\n\nWhen that starts to have problems you can worry about scaling while you roll around in all the money you made having successfully outgrown a conventional database.",

      "Maybe it\u2019s posturing. $8k MRR for 15 employees means there are investors, possibly a board. You buy enterprise software to justify their investment for a subsequent round to sustain your runway. You can run things with cheaper solutions but some work cultures don\u2019t take you seriously unless you buy the \u201cserious\u201d product.",

He spent a day talking to people and analyzing the problem. Then he made his proposal: move the two people key to this process into the same office, so their desks are next to each other and they can easily collaborate.\n\nNo big computer system needed, just a simple office move. Sometimes simple is better.",
      "8k a month is like a single contract for one person, how are they surviving on that\u00a0",
      "I agree with the sentiment if you have leaders forcing these tools on teams that have never used them. Paying consultants to implement Salesforce as a small company is also wild to me. But a lot of folks are comfortable with the big name tools and you can get basic accounts for super cheap if that's what your team members are used to using. We pay for several Atlassian products for this reason. It costs almost nothing for a handful of users.\n\n\nAlso, a specific note on HubSpot and email marketing. If you don't know about e-mail marketing reputation and how to manage it, you 100% need a tool that helps with that or you are wasting your time. If you don't set things up correctly out of thr gate, every single one of your emails will go straight to junk because you'll be auto-flagged as a spammer.",
      "This is a guy wasting money. I'd love to be hired as a consultant and then give you referral money OP.",
      "Some of the biggest companies like Amazon and Google would rather use homegrown or opensource tools over for profit software. Look at Amazon who developed their own ticketing systems and even their own call center software that later became an AWS service for customers.  Salesforce and the like has value especially when you\u2019re hiring talent who already know how to use it, but a lot of the time you have to insure that using someone else\u2019s business software doesn\u2019t make you form your business practices to theirs\u2026. And give up competitive advantage. \n\nIt\u2019s not always wrong\u2026. But it\u2019s also not always right.",
      "When I worked at a big company, we would never use freeway because \u201cthat\u2019s not what large companies do\u201d\n\nEven if it was a simple tool for a small case.\n\nWhere I work now we spend 10.00 a month on Jira and a bit on Miro but the rest is all Google sheets. \n\nWorks fine and won\u2019t change even when we scale from 8 devs right now to 20-30.\n\nIt works, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s fast, everyone is happy.\n\nOn the flip side if the dev team says we need X I get them it.

      "It's kind of wild.

And just want to skip ahead to the cool toys bit, see also laptops costing more than a CAD setup being used for occasional emails, massively over budget personal cars, glorious offices with ridiculousy high rent when no client visits. Etc etc\n\n\nAlso there seems to be a bit of a mindset that the tool will solve the problem, when it's often the process that's wrong.

I\u2019ve seen businesses spend thousands on tools they barely use because they want to feel \u2018serious\u2019. Meanwhile, the leaner ones scale faster with Google Sheets and common sense. I believe to start small and when it\u2019s needed you upgrade",
      "My honest thought is they do not know what they need exactly and what each tool does (and are good at), you went for the most heard option or the most expensive option. Sometimes trusting individuals that actually does not know what the f they are doing can be a reason.\n\n1. Two of my more recent experiences: When I joined my previous company, I learnt they use BOTH Hubspot and Salesforce, for different sales motion because \"the corresponding sales leader said they like it their way\". Shocking! I later learnt that none of the mentioned leaders had formal sales experience in an established company before. They can sell, but they have zero clue on how to run a revenue function, so they simply copy what they know of and sworn by it. \n2. We acquired a small business with around 30 people, most of them have junior working experience until they joined and grew in this company. I found they are using the very top tier of every service, including Zoom Conferences (the tier to host online conferences with thousands of people), because they want a landing page.\n\nWith this said. There is no software that is segment specific, just they are more tailored to a segment's need when it comes to feature, customisation, security etc. Small team can be using enterprise targeted software for a good reason, just unusual.",

We doubled or tripled in ARR 9 out of 12 years but the first 5 years I never made better than a min wage pay rate on an average work week approaching 60 hrs.  But by yr 12, the companies were collectively making $250M ARR and my life was changed. \n\nLet's say you want to sell a SW solution that will be used in classified agencies.

Later you'll bid small contracts with that big company as your subK.  \n\nThen you build on those relationships and introduce your SW in a test bed.  \n\nThe other way to get your SW in a govt agency is to sell it to the big primes, like Booze Allen, LockMart, Raytheon,  etc.  If you can convince them your SW gives them a better chance of winning a contract, they will do the selling for you.  \n\nAbsolutely do not try to win contracts thru RFP competitions if you don't have direct past perf in that agency.  Also hire a consultant to teach you the required bidding techniques.  Companies have lost bids for giving the correct info but not in the correct order,  or missing one page in the 3 copies of a 300 page proposal (back in the day when hard copies were submitted), or giving the correct solution but telling the govt they shouldn't do the job the way they've asked.",

      "The tech investor world is all about connections. The best and biggest investors mostly rely on warm intros to them because the thinking goes \"if you can't get a warm intro from a founder or other VC, then how can you be a big time business person?\". \n\nI recommend getting a Crunchbase account and sorting for the VCs and angels that are active. Build a list of 100 contacts minimum - then start cold emailing or submit your pitch deck on their website (some do that).\n\nYour objective is to get to the Partners at the firm if it's a VC. The Investor or Associate titles hold almost no power. Protip: Make sure that these investors are highly aligned with your product and business, there's very low probability that a Partner will chose to invest outside their typical thesis (like basically Zero), so don't waste your time.\n\nOnce you do a couple of pitches and get to know some investors, even if they pass, they can connect you to others. It's about getting to know the first ones and then building out your network from there. You will BOMB a lot, like seriously, a lot. But every time you'll get slightly better and can dial in the pitch and story more.\n\nWho you raise from really depends on your business and traction. The biotech investors can take on bigger risks when there's little to show on commercial traction but will give rock bottom valuations. The Deep / Hard tech investors will want at a minimum one or more letters of intend from a customer or early customer traction to get any funding, and they typically have better valuations.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "# 1. Match Your Ask to the Right Investor Type\n\nFor a $2M seed in biotech, traditional pre-seed tech VCs may not be a fit. Focus your initial list on:\n\n* Life sciences-focused funds (like IndieBio, Fifty Years, Bioverge, or Alexandria)\n* Family offices with a history in health or IP-heavy science\n* Strategic angels from biotech, pharma, or deep tech networks\n* Government-backed innovation funds in your region (SBIR, NIH grants if in the US)\n\nStart lean with a list of 25 to 30 targets that specifically invest in biotech seed or pre-clinical innovation.\n\n2. You will increase your hit rate with warm intros. Here are practical steps to get those:\n\n* Search Crunchbase for similar raises in your space over the last 12 to 18 months. Reach out to those founders and ask for a short chat\n* Join founder communities with a biotech or deep tech focus (On Deck Bio, Biotech Substack writers, PhD to Founder groups)\n* Use LinkedIn for second-degree intros. Most seed-stage intros come through one mutual connector\n\nWhen cold emailing, keep it short, specific, and data-grounded. Signal that you know your stage and category well.\n\n# 3. A Few Extras That Help Close Biotech Seed Rounds\n\n* Bring in a fundraising consultant/advisor with a strong network and track record in your domain\n* Have one or two external validators (advisor, KOL, former pharma exec) on your slide 2\n* Make your capital plan specific. Investors want to know how far $2M gets you and what you de-risk\n* Start building a waitlist or ecosystem now, even if the product is years out.

    "selftext": "Just listened to a founder who builds AI voice agents for big brands(2x founder here). He\u2019s been working on this for a while and recently raised a sizable round($80M), but what stood out wasn\u2019t the money. It was how far voice AI has come, and how only a few people seem to realize it.\nSome of the takeaways that stuck with me:\n\n1. Phone calls still work, and AI is finally good at them\nHe used to run a large contact center and noticed something odd. When his team emailed customers, about 2% would respond. When they called them, 20-30% picked up.\nMost of us assume no one answers phone calls anymore, but that\u2019s not true if someone has just signed up or asked for info. These are high-intent people. High-intent = Quality leads\nNow that AI agents can handle those conversations without screwing up, companies are quietly swapping humans out. Same results or better, but for a fraction of the cost.\n\n2. Companies keep testing AI in the wrong places\nOne mistake this founder sees all the time is teams running pilots on the smallest possible task. Things like six overnight calls per month. Even if the AI performs perfectly, it doesn\u2019t prove anything.\nThe best move is to pick something that matters to the business and test AI on just 1% of it. That\u2019s low risk, but high signal. It also helps the company get real feedback faster, without wasting cycles.\n\n3. Building the voice agent isn\u2019t the hard part\nA lot of people think the hard work is building the voice itself. It\u2019s not. That part is getting easier every day.\nWhat\u2019s difficult is everything around it. Routing the conversation correctly. Pulling in customer data. Knowing when to escalate. Running tests. Monitoring quality. Handling compliance. Most AI startups skip over all of that and assume the model is enough. It isn\u2019t.\n\n4. The funding didn\u2019t come from hype, it came from customer retention\nThey didn\u2019t raise money by pitching flashy ideas. They pitched customers first, not investors. If a customer liked even one slide in the deck, they\u2019d build that one thing and start charging. No product yet, but revenue came from day one.\nWhat convinced VCs later on wasn\u2019t growth. It was that the customers stuck around and kept using the product. That was the real signal.\n\nI always thought voice AI was too clunky to be useful. But after hearing this, it feels like we might be closer to a shift than most people realize.\n\nHas anyone here actually tried replacing parts of sales or support with voice AI? Curious whether it held up or fell apart under real-world pressure.\n",

However, there are two critical services I need - web re-design and some legal work. I've scowered the market and I know exactly what I need however it'll cost me $20k-25k. I don't have the cash but this will help me immensely.   \n  \nQuestion for you all: Should I consider 'Sweat Equity'? Basically convince these service providers to accept a discounted cash rate in exchange for a small slice of equity in my company. Anyone have any experience / wisdom in this? Any and all insights appreciated. ",

      "Problem with sweat equity, nobody believes in your startup as much as you do.\n\nSo the cost conversion for equity in your company will be disproportionately larger than the cash equivalent IF they decide to proceed on your offer.\n\nCash is king, and unless you have a very compelling product you're going to be hard pressed to find anyone to take you up on your offer that makes logical sense to you.",
      "Yes you should consider giving equity to workers if it will save the company. But if $25k is all you need to get to profitable positive cash flow in the near future you should also consider getting a small business loan. $25k is not a huge number and if you've been in business for a bit and can show consistent growth or stability I don't think you'll struggle to convince a lender you're good for the money.\n\nIf you don't want to get a loan, yes, offering equity is absolutley a viable option. If your company is going to die on the vine without this cash injection/getting the labor done, it's better to own 85% of a profitable company than 100% of nothing. But it's not so easy to convince people to work for free. And yes, it is working for free until there is a liquidity event, which takes 7+ years on average. And its much harder to convince a service provider to take equity than it is to convince an individual.\n\nI would look into loans. $25k could also be covered but a friends & family round, though I don't know what your network is like.",
      "When you give someone equity, you put them on your cap table. That means you'll be pulling them around with you for the rest of your startup's life unless you 1) buy them out or 2) you exercise a clawback provision for failure to perform. If you never need to raise, maybe that's ok but you'll still have pro-rata payment obligations. If you do need to raise, it may be a sticking point for future investors (and for you). You'll also have to be very clear about the terms (dilution, capital calls, etc.) It's rarely as easy as just \"here's 10% of my company\" if you want to avoid real challenges down the road.\n\nIf you've got 12 paying customers, they're not substantially discounted, and you've been operational long enough to assert solid metrics around usage and churn, you might consider what other commenters are suggesting and figure out a way to finance additional growth.\n\nIf you are set on bringing somebody in, check out Slicing Pie and see if it's helpful (I have no affiliation with them, it's just an interesting tool). Just be sure to raise your standards for vetting people that work for free. Sometimes, you get what you pay for and end up with a lot of dead weight in your cap table.",

      "Yes, sweat equity can work - but only in very specific cases. A few things to think about before you offer it:\n\nMake sure they actually *want* equity. Most service providers prefer cash. If they agree to equity, it usually means they believe in your business, they know you personally, or they\u2019re just starting out and want portfolio work. So don\u2019t assume equity alone will convince anyone.\n\nGet everything in writing. Be super clear about scope, timeline, and vesting. You don\u2019t want a situation where someone does half the job and walks away with shares. Use a proper contract and involve a lawyer if possible (ironic, I know, since you also need legal help).\n\nBe careful about how much equity you give. It's tempting to overpay with shares when you have no cash. But down the road, every fraction matters. If you\u2019re building a high-growth startup, even 1% is a lot.\n\nLastly, pick people you\u2019d actually want in your cap table long-term. If things go well, they\u2019ll be part-owners. Make sure that\u2019s someone you trust.",
      "You may find web designers and developers who are willing to work for equity. There is a lot of junior developers looking for any work experience nowadays.

Be careful with your cap table.  \nGiving away equity early\u2014even a small amount\u2014can create long-term issues if it's not structured well. Investors will want a clean cap table and may push back on having non-core contributors holding shares unless there's a clear rationale.\n\n2. Use equity like currency, not a favor.  \nEquity has real value. If you're offering it to a service provider, treat it like compensation: negotiate deliverables, timelines, and exit clauses just like you would with a paid vendor. A lot of headaches come when this isn\u2019t done formally.\n\n3. Consider a hybrid model.  \nMany early-stage companies negotiate a reduced cash fee + small equity kicker (often in the form of advisory shares or restricted stock/NSOs). This keeps people incentivized but avoids large upfront equity grants. For example: 50% of normal rate in cash, with 0.25\u20130.5% equity that vests over 6\u201312 months.\n\n4. Protect your future self.  \nYou\u2019ll want to document everything with clear terms: vesting schedules, cliff periods, what happens if the work isn\u2019t completed, or if the service provider disappears. If it\u2019s not structured right, this can spook future investors.\n\n5. Legal work via sweat equity = double caution.  \nFor legal services in particular, equity arrangements can trigger ethics and conflict concerns for lawyers depending on jurisdiction. Some firms do it, but many avoid it unless they have a specific startup-focused model.\n\nIf you go this route, make sure you\u2019re getting fair value and protecting the company's long-term interests. Sweat equity can be a useful tool\u2014but like all equity, it's expensive money.",
      "Yeah, I feel you on this one. That whole \"do I give up cash or control\" thing is such a classic founder headache, especially when you're bootstrapping.\n\nLook, sweat equity isn't necessarily bad, but man, I've seen it go sideways so many times. Here's what I've learned from watching other founders (sometimes painfully):\n\nFirst off, only do it with genuinely all-in people. Like, people who care about your success, not just someone looking to make a quick buck. If someone's treating it like a regular gig, don't give them a piece of your baby.\n\nAnd for the love of all that's holy, write everything down. I mean everything - what they need to deliver, when they need to deliver it, what happens if they don't. Because nothing kills relationships faster than unclear expectations around equity.\n\nHere's the thing that stings, though - I know so many founders who handed out equity early on (especially to developers and designers) and then kicked themselves later. When you're trying to raise money or sell, those little equity chunks can make your cap table look like a mess. Plus, it can make you look inexperienced to investors.\n\nHave you thought about equity crowdfunding? I know it sounds a bit out there, but some founders I know have used it to raise just enough to pay people properly without giving away long-term equity. You stay in control, everyone gets paid fairly, and your cap table stays clean.\n\nEither way, though, you're asking the right questions now. Trust me, future you will thank present you for being protective of your equity. I will not promote.",
      "Only if the person you\u2019re offering equity to knows how to make that equity worth something. Otherwise you\u2019re trading real value (their time) for a maybe. I\u2019ve seen this go well once and only because the designer was also advising on GTM and stayed involved long enough to turn the brand into revenue. Most of the time, sweat equity just delays failure with prettier assets. If you do it, tie equity to milestones, not hours. That keeps everyone honest.",
      "25k for web dev seems like a big price unless you mean an web app, with rich functionality, not a website. Sounds like you may be hiring within your country and it\u2019s not a cheap one.  When I started I worked a lot harder to spend way less money but now even though I am still relatively small I am profitable with lower cost resources and a really great team.  Just making sure you are looking at this from all angles.",
      "It is unclear how much web re-design & legal work you need to get done, but $20k-$25k sounds way too much. \n\n\nYou should rather find a low-cost provider for both. \n\n\nGiving away Sweat Equity for Web Design or Legal is neither likely to work nor recommended (because neither of those are likely to be related to the Core of your Business). \n\n\nSweat Equity should be reserved only for things that are **critical** for your Business."

One of these days I\u2019ll have to leave the job, I\u2019m just trying to hold it as long as I can because I have bills to pay",
      "I think it really comes down to knowing yourself, and what you\u2019re responsible for. If you know you\u2019re a person that struggles to maintain energy after work, or wants some kind of life besides your startup as your one and only hobby, working full time and building on the side just isn\u2019t sustainable long term. It\u2019s best to be data-driven and not speculative. Take an honest inventory of how much time you spend on your FTE, how much you can actually advance the startup, and how much time you have for your life. Average over a few weeks to smooth outliers. \n\nScenario A: For your FTE, you work remotely part of the week and can get away with about 35 hours of week to maintain solid performance. Won\u2019t get any promotions for extra effort but won\u2019t get cut with the bottom 10%. Assuming you sleep 8 hours, that gives you about 45 hours a week for other life things, and then 32 hours of not-sleeping on the weekends. If you live with someone who can take over grocery store, cooking, housekeeping, etc. then you can conceivably fit a full work week (40 hours) in on your startup, maybe more, across all 7 days. In this case, you could keep working a long time and still make good progress on the startup.\n\nScenario B: You\u2019re salaried and have to work more than a standard 8-4. Closer to 50 hours a week (about two hours at home every night to catch up or prep for things later in the week). Your partner also works, so you share household responsibilities. Maybe they have a health thing and can only pull 40% and you pick up the slack like cooking AND cleaning most nights. You realistically can only get 2-3 hours of real work done a day during the week, and something always comes up where one day a week at least it\u2019s just not happening. Weekend you have more responsibilities so can only get 4 hours one day and 2 the other because there\u2019s always some place to be/someone\u2019s mom to take care of for the afternoon, etc. This is more like 18 hours a week on the startup. This is less than half of A, so everything will be more than twice as slow.\n\nThe alternative: Working startup full time. Even in scenario B, you can clear 40 + 18 hours every week (you already proved you could) but probably a few more because there is less context switching and less needing to put something down while you\u2019re in the middle of it then needing to re-load your brain days later to figure out what you were doing when you had to stop. \n\nAlready you\u2019re moving 3x faster in scenario B, and in Scenario A the scaling isn\u2019t as extreme but the magnitude of being able to clear 60-80 hours if you wanted/needed in a week is unparalleled.\n\nBasically, you have to make the call on how far from revenue you are to know when to take the leap, and how much in control of that gap you are. If it\u2019s going to take 6 months whether you\u2019re doing 20 hours or 60, it\u2019s better to keep the day job. But the value of being able to work full time and then some on your startup shouldn\u2019t be discounted. What would have taken you 9 months you can do in 3, and so if you can start making money by then it\u2019s not actually that long to be in the lurch and the startup is in a better place for it.\n\nDepending on your industry, going to slow could kill your startup before you even leave the nest, and then all of those nights and weekends would have been for nothing because you\u2019ve been eclipsed or made obsolete by some new technology.",
      "Im there too. Working full time and working on my company nights and weekends. It's a grind. I still work my day job with conviction and discuss growth and the future, cuz ya never know. Idk if it's gonna take me 6 months or 2 years to reach the point I can go full time on my company.\u00a0\n\n\nI try hard to have boundaries. I don't work on my project on company grounds or company hardware. If I'm working from home or travelling, I'll have both laptops open at once doing double duty.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm cool with my coworkers and some of them are even aware of my extracurricular efforts, and they're cheering me on. I keep the boss in the dark tho.\u00a0\n\n\nLastly, it's important to make room for health and well-being.\u00a0",
      "Acting like you love your day job while sneaking in startup work is emotional infidelity. Try serving two masters and you\u2019ll fail both.

They are high-curiosity, high-stop-factor ideas that feel unexpected, subversive, or creatively jarring.\n\nUse this format:\n\nHook\n\n\u2192 Why it works (tension, contrast, truth, or pattern disruption)\n\n\u2192 Where it might be used (ad scroll-stopper, cold email opener, hero tagline)\n\nConstraints:\n\n* Avoid startup clich\u00e9s, formulaic copy, and vague benefit statements\n* You may use humour, contradiction, specificity, or cultural reference\u2014only if grounded in prior brand tone\n\nThese hooks should feel risky-smart, not silly or absurd\n\n3. Then we pasted in her website URL and the following prompt to generate landing page specific messaging based on all of the previous insights:\n\n**PROMPT**:\n\nAct as an SEO and conversion rate optimisation strategist. Review this homepage copy:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* Suggest a stronger H1 using previously shared inputs on positioning, hook, messaging, and angles\u00a0\n* Improve clarity and flow for readers\u00a0\u00a0\n* Check if CTA appears in the first screen\u00a0\u00a0\n* Rewrite body copy using brand tone\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso generate a meta title and meta description using \\[keyword\\].\n\n**Why It Worked**\n\n1. **Sharper wedge** \\- We named the specific pain (dyspareunia) + specific demographic (40 +).\n2. **Copy friction = zero** \\- One headline swap, one paragraph tweak. Easy A/B.\n3. **No other variables changed** \\- Clear attribution. 100% lift consistent over 2 weeks from that strategic tweak.\n\n**Try It**\n\nIf you\u2019re converting <2.5% on the same traffic volume, run these prompts, swap only your hero copy, and watch for a week.\n\nHappy to give feedback on anyone\u2019s before/after line, drop it in the comments and I\u2019ll reply with thoughts (no links needed).\n\ni will not promote",

Then you can run your prompt stack with laser focus on the exact sections that need fixing.\n\nYour strategic framework + knowing where to apply it = maximum impact with minimum effort."

Having some kind of community already established in whatever area is going to be important.\n\nYou also have to be able to make some kind of noise: \n\nIs there a college in the town? Is there a local celebrity or influencer who can vouch for helping/ using the app? Can you get a bunch of students to do it, maybe offering a prize or gift card(s)? Is there some kind of local media you can enlist in writing a story about your idea? Maybe the chamber of commerce can introduce you to businesses who can promote this or contribute to it?  Does the local news have someone who does human interest stories? Does your grandma have a group of women who meet to play bridge that would be down to help?

But I quickly realized (or at least I think I did) that it\u2019s crucial to pick one channel, focus on it, and really master it before moving on to others.\n\nSo here\u2019s my simple question: What was the most cost-effective and efficient channel for your startup launch? SEO? Paid? Social? Thank you :) ",

Whether it was a pinned Reddit comment, a founder post in a niche Slack, or a one-time email drop to a partner list, the common thread was message-to-market match. Most launches stall because the offer isn\u2019t sharp enough to land anywhere with force. Fix that, and almost any channel works.",

      "Congrats on the launch. Meetups and sponsoring small events is easy, and  great way to get human relations with early users, usually also better if you're selling devtools or business customers. \n\nFor consumers probably local or topical influencers, you can find options at different budgets, also depending on how many users you can technically onboard and expect.",
      "First off, congrats! Launching is an incredibly exciting milestone.   \n  \nTo answer your question, It 100% depends on what you're product is and who your ideal customers are. Is the product B2C or B2B? Is it niche? Is it more of a service than a  product? Would need a lot more information to give any real prescriptive advice.   \n  \nIf this is the first time your product is making contact with the public, you honestly shouldn't plan on SEO, Social (organic or paid), or digital ads being effective channel for you at the moment. They can ultimately be, but aren't in the beginning unless you get really lucky and strike a major gap in the market with the right positioning. However, you can use some of those channels now but your focus should be less on getting customers and more on gauging interest, testing different positioning statements with different demographics and ideal customer personas.   \n  \nThat said, if you don't have any paying customers yet - **HAND SELL, HAND SELL, HAND SELL.** At this stage, you're only trying to validate that people are willing to pay for your product/solution. You can very easily digitally market a great product and still not be able to find customers, but it's much harder to hand sell a great product and not find customers. Which means you'll validate or learn what you need to change MUCH faster.   \n  \n**I would HIGHLY suggest that you don't even bother with anything other than a basic website at this point.** Go hand sell your product or service, whatever it may be. Talking to your potential customers will get you WAY more insight and actionable information than any digital initiatives could ever do and those channels can be a large resource drain, both in terms of time and money.\n\nWhen you speak with potential customers directly, you get real and instantaneous feedback that will tell you what resonates and what doesn't. Being able to ask why they aren't willing to pay for your product or (hopefully!) if they'd be willing to pay more, is invaluable and will inform so many decisions downstream from now. More often than not, startups are surprised by the real \"who\" and \"why\" behind their customers and thus the initial marketing strategy ends up changing entirely. \n\nOnce you have a few paying customers that you know very well, you can then start to understand who your potential customers are, where they are, and how/when to pitch your product to them.  That's when the digital channels become effective! \n\nEither way, as someone who's been through this a few times myself, keep your hopes high and expectations low with the launch. Most unicorns struggled desperately to get their first customers. Hopefully that isn't the case for you but understand that if it is, that doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong or that you're not on still onto something. Just talk to people, get the feedback, make adjustments, and stick with it!   \n  \nCongrats and good luck!!!",

Instead, I created a video tutorial on a trending topic **\u201cUber Clone App using React Native\u201d**. It\u2019s something many devs search for, so it naturally pulled attention.\n\nHere\u2019s the twist: I provided the full source code **for free**, but hosted it on my own platform. To download it, users had to **sign up**. That\u2019s how I onboarded my first 100+ users, without running ads or shouting about my platform.\n\nSo yeah, indirect marketing + useful content + a bit of funnel thinking = solid start",
      "For us, long-form SEO content combined with Reddit traffic brought the best early traction. It took a few weeks to rank, but the results were compounding and free.",
      "If you want free SEO that actually ranks, posting on product launching platforms such as Product Hunt, Hacker News, Indie Hackers, and Reddit helps because they build really quick SEO. Other than that, I think making sure that you are messaging the right people in the right channels who have the problem that your product solves would be great, because they will be the ones who might adopt it and share it with other people as well.\n\nAdditionally, you might have used certain tools and tech stacks in building your platform, and those communities would also be supportive in helping you launch quickly.",
      "Everyone defaults to paid ads or SEO. Wrong way to think about it.\n\n  \nMy most successful launch didn't use any of those at first. The entire focus was building a pre launch waitlist. Created a simple landing page and a referral system. The more people someone referred, the higher up the waitlist they got.\n\n  \nThis built an audience that was actually ready and waiting for the product. By the time we launched, we already had a massive list of users ready to go on day one. It validates your idea before you even launch."

    "selftext": "Seen that in many early-stage startups, culture gets pushed to the sidelines. It's easy to assume it can be formalized later after funding, traction, or hiring. But by the time cracks appear, they\u2019re usually already affecting execution, retention, and morale.\n\nA common pattern is what some call **Frankenstein culture** a patchwork of founder habits, copied corporate rituals, and rushed decisions made under pressure. It may feel functional at a small team size, but as the company grows, the lack of intentionality becomes visible. The tone is set early, often unconsciously.\n\nInstead of defined norms, these cultures end up with vague rituals: *Transparency* becomes selective sharing, *flat hierarchy* results in unclear ownership and *candor* looks like criticism.\n\nOver time, the outcomes are subtle but consistent: \n\nNew hires feel peripheral and underperform before it\u2019s flagged. Social cliques form and limit collaboration. Inconsistent recognition creates quiet disengagement. Pace is prioritized over sustainability, and strong contributors pull back.  \n\nThis is a **culture debt** that is cumulative and expensive to unwind.\n\nEarly signs are often behavioral in your company:\n\n1. A few voices dominate every discussion\n2. Interruptions go unchecked, overstepping happens often\n3. High-potential team members stop contributing\n4. One to one meets, feel routine instead of meaningful\n5. Certain people are included out of obligation, not trust!\n\nDifference between long-term stability and silent attrition often comes down to consistency in behavior.\n\nInvestors pay attention to culture, even if founders deprioritize it. And they often sense foundational cracks well before they\u2019re formalized in metrics.\n\nAs one investor, told Airbnb\u2019s Brian Chesky:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t f\\*ck up the culture.\u201d That wasn\u2019t just advice. It was a signal to keep the great culture they already had!\n\nHere's hoping you have great rounds! :)\n\n",

      "This is spot on. The Frankenstein culture thing hits home - I've seen it play out so many times with founders I know through founders dinners I host.\n\n\n\nWhat I've noticed is that most founders know culture matters, but they treat it like this abstract thing that's \"nice to have\" rather than something that directly impacts your bottom line. The reality is that bad culture creates friction everywhere - hiring takes longer, people leave faster, decisions get stuck in weird loops.\n\n\n\nAt Twine we learned this the hard way during our growth phase. We went from a tight team where everyone just \"got it\" to suddenly having people who felt like outsiders. The informal ways we used to communicate didn't scale and we started seeing exactly what you described - the same few people dominating meetings, others just checking out.\n\n\n\nRushing hiring due to growth targets, covid and hiring through covid also made us make some missteps.\n\n\n\nThe thing that helped us was being stupidly explicit about stuff we thought was obvious. Like actually writing down how we make decisions, what good feedback looks like, and how we handle communication. Sounds basic, but most teams never do it.\n\n\n\nYour point about investors noticing is so true. They can smell dysfunction from a mile away, especially in how the founding team interacts during pitches. I've had VCs tell me they passed on deals not because of the product but because they could see the team would implode.\n\n\n\nThe behavioural signs you listed are gold. Especially the one about high-potential people stopping contributing - that one's usually the canary in the coal mine. By the time you notice it, the damage is already spreading.\n\n\n\nCulture debt is such a good way to put it. Just like technical debt, it compounds, and eventually you have to pay it back with interest.",

    "selftext": "Here's what most founders don't understand: fundraising isn\u2019t about your deck, it\u2019s about how you\u2019re introduced. 90% of the work is done before you ever pitch.  \n  \nIf you\u2019re introduced to an investor via a founder who\u2019s made them a ton of money, you\u2019re way more likely to raise.  \n  \nThe average intro is more along the lines of - \u201cHey, I met this guy at a party, he seems to be building something cool. Connecting you two. Hope it helps!\u201d  \n  \nThe odds are then stacked against you, and it\u2019s on you to show why you\u2019re worth the investor\u2019s time.   \n  \nHere\u2019s an better, more actionable way to actually build connections and raise:  \n  \nTypically investors are bombarded with emails, so the best way (as any investor would tell you) is to get introduced to them through someone. The easiest way for you to do that is via another founder.  \n  \nStart attending startup events. These things compound. Another thing you could do is host founder mixers. Invite every founder in your network and ask them to get a +1. Make a list of the ones who may know another investor and invite them to the next one. Do this a couple times every month.  \n  \nGive this time. In 3-4 months you\u2019ll have a bunch of founders who have the potential to intro you.  \n  \nThe goal is to make friends. Just have fun. If you befriend a cool founder who\u2019s raised a round of funding, ask them if you could have a chat about your startup with their investor IF they really like what you\u2019re building.  \n  \nThis is very important because if they go to the investor raving about you, it\u2019s gonna make your life significantly easier.  \n  \nNow, this is where most people mess up. Don\u2019t start pitching right away. You want to approach the conversation under the guise of - \u201cHey, I\u2019m building a startup and would love an opinion on what we\u2019re building.\u201d  \n   \nIf the investor really likes your startup, they\u2019ll propose getting into the round themselves. By pitching you forgo all the leverage you had in that conversation.  \n  \nAnyway, get a bunch of these and try to get a round to close within a week or two so you have momentum.   \n   \nI have a lot more to say on building momentum during a fundraise, but I\u2019ll probably dedicate this to a future post. Hope this helps!",

      "What most people miss is the bridge language between the founder and investor. A warm intro only works if the person making it knows how to frame you. That means you need to spoon-feed them the 1\u20132 lines that make you sound like a bet worth making. Something like \u201cthey\u2019re building X, early traction looks like Y, and it reminds me of Z which you were in early on.\u201d I\u2019ve seen intros flop simply because the forward didn\u2019t land.

Market research is less about asking if they want your idea and more about figuring out the right questions to ask. This was a surreal moment for me when I realized instead of asking, \"would you want xyz,\" I started asking, \"have you tried to build xyz?\" Changing the question helped gauge what people actually wanted. \n\n3. Be consistent. Being this early in the process, it definitely feels like I'm just chucking things into the void. That said, I can tell being consistent can be freaky especially since I don't always know where to start. I found its helpful to just throw something into the wind and make a plan from there. Doesn't hurt to us chatgpt to ask what a marketing campaign or a posting schedule should look like to get some ideas off the ground. \n\n4. Buckle down on just a few platforms. Dare I say just two. For me its X and reddit.

      "Building a multimedia company sounds super exciting! The creative industries are full of opportunities, and it's great that you're focusing on supporting emerging artists. For the business model, I'd suggest considering how to leverage digital platforms to drive visibility for the artists you work with. One approach might involve using AI to enhance your content delivery and improve engagement, particularly in those short-form visuals. There are tools like [WonderShark.ai](http://WonderShark.ai) that help brands integrate seamlessly into digital content, boosting their online presence. This could help you and your artists gain more traction in a crowded market. Definitely explore collaborations with brands that align with your artists' ethos as that's another way to monetize your content! Good luck with everything!",

Here are a few things to look for:\n\n* How readable is the code? Will your developer be able to understand what it does? Startups tend to have poorly structured code, so this is something to watch for.\n* How common is the stack? If it uses something obscure, you'll find it difficult and expensive to put a team together.\n* How buggy is it? Small bugs are acceptable, but keep an eye out for anything serious.\n* What are the running costs? Are there API fees? How about hosting? What resources are required?\n\nAgain, these are just a few things you should look for from a technical perspective.

One thing to consider is the importance of user experience; it can really make or break how people interact with your reading assistant. I\u2019ve seen some companies leverage AI to enhance brand visibility and attract the right audience, which could be useful if you're looking to market your app effectively. The right strategies here could help boost your reach when it's time to launch. Excited to see where you take this!",
      "This is actually a solid idea and there's definitely a market for it. I work at an AI consulting firm and we've seen growing demand for educational AI tools that go beyond basic summarization. The problem with most reading apps is they either oversimplify everything or just add generic annotations that don't help with comprehension.\n\nYour approach of contextual explanation and adaptive highlighting could work really well for dense philosophical texts. The challenge is that most people who struggle with Hayek or similar authors aren't just missing vocabulary - they're missing entire conceptual frameworks. Your AI would need to understand not just what the text says, but what intellectual tradition it's coming from and how to bridge that gap for modern readers.\n\nThe personalization angle is smart too. Someone coming to \"The Road to Serfdom\" from an economics background needs different support than someone approaching it from a political science perspective. If you can actually adapt explanations based on the user's existing knowledge and reading goals, that's genuinely valuable.\n\nThe technical execution is going to be tricky though. You'll need really good content understanding to identify which passages actually need explanation versus just being challenging. And the background information feature could easily become distracting rather than helpful if it's not implemented thoughtfully.\n\nThe market timing might be right - people are getting tired of oversimplified content but still want accessibility tools for complex material. Your TikTok background probably gives you good insights into what makes content engaging without dumbing it down.\n\nMain risk is that building this well requires serious NLP capabilities and a lot of content expertise. Most similar tools I've seen either have great AI but shit content knowledge, or good educational design but mediocre technology. Getting both right is expensive and time-consuming."

Maybe even put up a public roadmap or a 'what's new' list to show off these changes.\n\nAs for building versus getting the word out, yeah, that's always a tough one! But for niche dev tools, content marketing often works wonders. I'm talking about real technical articles or tutorials, not just 'buy my product' posts, where your tool naturally solves a problem. So, if your tool helps with mobile app boilerplate, for instance, you could write a guide like 'The X common headaches of starting a mobile app' and gently introduce your solution. Also, just genuinely being active in dev communities \u2013 like specific subreddits, Discord servers, or Stack Overflow if it fits \u2013 and helping answer questions where your tool could genuinely be useful (without being spammy!) can be incredibly effective. Anyway, good luck with everything, sounds like you're already doing great! \ud83d\ude09",
      "Congratulations on your launch! Here are some channels that work well for dev-focused products:\n\nFree marketing channels: Product Hunt and Hacker News are goldmines for developer tools - lots of community support and zero cost. Also try IndiaHackers and [daily.dev](http://daily.dev) communities.\n\nReddit strategy: Find developer communities where people actively discuss tools. When you get responses, offer extended access to build word-of-mouth.\n\nWebsite messaging: This is crucial and often overlooked. Your site needs to clearly differentiate you from competitors and speak directly to what developers actually want to hear. We built [BrandStori.ai](http://BrandStori.ai) specifically for this - it helps you audit whether your messaging resonates with your target developers before you push traffic there.\n\nThe key is making sure your website converts once you drive traffic from these channels. Too many good products get buried because their messaging doesn't connect with their audience.\n\nKeep building momentum - those early sales are a great sign you're solving a real problem!",

Depending on your chosen vendor, you may need to build additional instrumentation to get fine-grained logs per user \u2194 model \u2194 tool interaction, especially to satisfy FERPA.\n* **Consent + purpose tracking**: School districts often want proof that each AI interaction stays within a clearly defined scope. This means grounding agent behavior in purpose, and having a way to surface that contextually during audits or review boards.\n* **Explaining behavior**: This is a big one. Without visibility into prompt chains and decisions made by agents or LLMs, legal/compliance teams get skittish fast. We've seen success when teams can trace back model behavior with real-time flow graphs or even generate explainability artifacts on demand.\n\nWe ended up building custom tooling for this, but are now using a dedicated AI security layer to handle it\u2014especially one that can simulate risky behavior before it hits prod.\n\nTL;DR biggest surprises: 1) how fast \u2018playground\u2019 apps become compliance headaches when they touch real student data, 2) how often district reviews require traceability + explainability, not just guardrails.\n\nHappy to share a deeper breakdown of what schools tend to expect during procurement if helpful.",

I've tried exploring Bolt, Loveable, Bloom, etc, however I'm unsure if these apps do a good enough job to actually ship the app to an end user. \n\nHave you guys tried any tool that you recommend and one that actually works/functional? Thanks! ",
    "comments": [
      "I've followed this playbook and it's going well so far:   \n  \n1. Start with Lovable. Use their 5 daily credits as a starting point. Once the MVP features are in place...  \n  \n2. Import to Replit. It has a native Lovable > Replit conversion tool that works well. Refine the app using the Agent. Sync to Github. When the app is in a good place (i.e minor bugs, UI/UX tweaks remain)...  \n  \n3. Import into Cursor or VS Code. Download the Kilo Code Cursor/VSC extension and claim the $20 in free credits. Use Claude 4 Sonnet to finish up your app. Set up Supabase at this step if you haven't already. \n\nVoila! You have an MVP app ready to test without breaking the bank.",
      "I think the word you are looking for is prototype because it won't be viable if you don't know what you are doing.",
      "replit is very good for fullstack web mvps",
      "For quickly shipping a functional MVP, I\u2019ve found Softr and Glide super effective; have you tried either for getting a live version in front of users fast?",
      "Ive built initially production ready stuff on base44 (ull need to redevelop it for scale but thats just life). It has built in database which seemed to me to make life much easier. Honestly it makes lovable look like a toy. You need to be on the $50/mo plan to use your own domain which sucks but otherwise it feels 2 levels above.",
      "The tools you mentioned are pretty hit or miss for actually shipping something users will pay for. Working at an AI consulting firm, I see a lot of our clients get excited about these rapid prototyping tools, but the gap between demo and production-ready is still enormous.\n\nBolt and the others are decent for getting a visual prototype that looks impressive in screenshots, but they fall apart when you need real user authentication, data persistence, error handling, or any kind of scalability. The code they generate is usually a mess that's harder to maintain than starting from scratch.\n\nFor MVPs that need to actually function, you're probably better off with more traditional rapid development approaches. If you can code at all, something like Next.js with Supabase or Firebase gets you to a working product faster than trying to wrangle AI-generated code into something deployable. The AI tools are great for generating boilerplate and UI components, but they can't architect a coherent application.\n\nIf you're non-technical, honestly the fastest path to a real MVP is probably hiring a freelance developer for a week or two rather than trying to make these AI tools work. The time you'll spend debugging generated code and figuring out deployment usually exceeds just paying someone who knows what they're doing.\n\nThe one area where these tools actually work well is for landing pages and simple marketing sites. If your MVP is more about validating demand than building complex functionality, something like v0 from Vercel can get you a decent static site pretty quickly.\n\nBut if you need user accounts, payment processing, real-time features, or any backend logic beyond basic CRUD operations, you're going to hit walls with the current generation of AI development tools.

Don't try to be \"modern\" just for the sake of it. Make your product feel familiar to your users.\n\n\\- Watch your words: Steer clear of terms that have a bad rap, like \"NFTs.\" Find creative ways to describe your tokenized assets, like calling them \"Digitally Certified Tickets.\"\n\n\\- Keep it simple: Hide the web3 parts of your solution from the user. They don't need to know it's running on a blockchain, and that's for the best.\n\n\\- Create a user roadmap: Some users will want to learn more. Make sure there are ways for them to dig deeper and get more involved.\n\n\\- Give users a voice: Let your users speak their minds, maybe in a forum or somewhere similar. Give them a place to ask questions and suggest new ideas.\n\nRWAs are powerful, and they aren't new anymore.

If market doesn\u2019t like my idea - it\u2019s a failure and end of story, nobody is going to invest in something unprofitable.\n\nWith this logic as late as I go to ask for investment - more valuable my startup will be.\n\nExample - on idea level the value is $100k On basic mvp its $1mln On prod with real paid customers its $10mln\n\nAt the same time i got an advise from investor to go to investors sooner better. He admitted value with real customers will be higher.\n\nAs the result I will meet solid investors next week. For the first time. I don\u2019t need them at this stage but will see what they going to offer (I assume less cause we are not in prod yet).\n\nSo generally speaking should I wait and hold till I see at least some serious profit / traffic/ users ?",

And that\u2019s time away from you actually growing the business.\u00a0\n\nBut, networking is also always important. Being on good terms with people able to put money into your business, or connect you with important clients, is always a good thing.\n\nJust don\u2019t walk into that meeting all \u201dI don\u2019t need you, but let\u2019s hear your best offers\u201d. You thinking that you don\u2019t need them at the moment doesn\u2019t mean that they need or want you.\n\nAs an investment opportunity you\u2019re basically worthless to them rn, and that means that you risk pissing them off having wasted their time if you don\u2019t approach these meetings at least with a fa\u00e7ade of being open to investors based on what you find your initial traction to be.\n\nThink of it as being an invited guest in a very different culture with different social rules than what you\u2019re familiar with. Tread warily until you understand it and what they say actually means.\u00a0\n\nAnd these people talk with each other. Doesn\u2019t matter if they seem like bitter competitors, they talk. And if you go at it all gung-ho with ignorance and inflated sense of importance it could have the same results as burning every damn bridge before you\u2019ve crossed them, as well as basically having blacklisted yourself.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of first time founders absolutely ruin their futures by screwing up how they initially approached the startup/investor community.\n\nYou initially need to listen and reply more than anything. As well as prepare by reading about other people\u2019s experiences with investors.\n\nStart by making sure you understand the meaning behind why investors care about the information in things like:\n\n[https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/](https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\\_model\\_canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model_canvas)\n\nYour goal with these meetings shouldn\u2019t be to with crossed arms listen to their offers, it should be to with as few words and as little active pitching as possible come across as someone that they want to invest in no matter the project that you\u2019re working on. And you do that by coming across as knowledgeable and able to execute, not arrogant with an inflated ego due to ignorance.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve patented the cure for cancer you, and your team, will always be more important than your project to most investors. Because good teams will as a rule have good projects, but good ideas will not necessarily mean a good team able to execute.\u00a0",

Hell no.\n\nWhat works instead is progressive onboarding. Give them one small win immediately, then gradually introduce complexity. Slack doesn't start with channel organization and notification settings. You join a workspace, see messages happening, send one message, get a reply.

We are 3 people, 2 months in, only prototype, no revenue etc. 3 small design partners who I got LOIs from, and happy to be the pilot customers. Some interest from reps from larger companies, but not from decision makers. Mostly from ideal users. I do believe PMF is promising. So nothing commercially tangible, but all hopes so far \ud83d\ude02 Properly starting up. I'm the founder. Bringing in the other 2.\n\nI'm a product guy with 15years of relatively respectable experience. I built the prototype (well vibe coded it really for a few weeks. Nothing close to production level, especially considering it's an enterprise software. but enough to demo investors and potential customers to get early traction). I'm talking to investors, potential customers, designing the UX, doing the market research, talking to a few advisors, trying to get the business off the ground with all my time and ability..\n\nPersonA is fresh PhD grad in a technical relevant area from a well respected uni. He joined very early on, right after his PhD is done while unemployed and looking for a job. No sector experience, hence needs guidance. Genuinely smart guy, doing IC with all his abilities to get a production app live. In the future he will help with the AI side of things, building the engine etc.\n\nPersonB has 20+ years experience in enterprise software, similar academic credentials. he will be the CTO. He recently quit his job, will join in a few months after his notice, closer to the fundraising (I did say we are a hopeful bunch \ud83d\ude05) He is in an interesting situation, as he will receive some income in another country (more than I can pay for a long time), as long as he is not getting paid somewhere else. So he is happy NOT being paid for 18 months, and only work for the equity - at least for the foreseeable future, without much of a financial risk. Although he can go work for a decent company as CTO, and make even more. But market is also a bit shit. :) he also believes in the product.\n\nWhat's the most fair share distribution between 3 of us?\n",

      "Navigating equity distribution can really be complicated, especially in the early days of a startup. It sounds like you have a great diversity of skills on your team, which is a huge advantage. When it comes to fair share distribution, a common method is to look at the time each person can commit, the skills they bring to the table, and how critical they are for the development phase. Sometimes, it helps to visualize the impact each team member has on getting the product to market.\n\n\n\nAlso, it might be useful to focus on how you plan to showcase your startup as you continue building. For instance, effective branding even at this stage can play a significant role in attracting potential partners or users in the future. Tools like [WonderShark.ai](http://WonderShark.ai) can help with integrating your brand into the narrative of your AI solutions, ultimately boosting your visibility when you\u2019re ready to engage investors or customers. Just my two cents, and best of luck with your venture!"

    "title": "Deferred allocation of shares on Cap Table an option? | I will not promote",
    "selftext": "\\[I will not promote\\]\n\n**Context:**\n\nGetting ready to spin out a deep technology startup out of graduate school within the next few months. I recently defended my PhD and graduated in May, and my co-founder is also a PhD candidate preparing to finish up within the next year. We have worked together for several years at this point and have demonstrated an ability to work well together and resolve conflicts, but some subjects like equity allocation remain touchy with a lot of conflicting motivations on how to do things and why. We are starting with some cash in the bank but no revenue, so equity is all we have for compensation for a while.\n\nI have been preparing to spin out a startup for the duration of my program, and so over that time have learned enough about launching a startup, running a business, etc. to get started, and have also invested significant time in developing a professional network in the beachhead market to have personal relationships with our early leads. The technology (hardware and software) is also something that I initially developed on my own, and I have made concerted effort to learn how to do things \"professionally\" and in a scalable way vs. what works in academia (i.e., writing code in scripts that only the author can read, etc.).\n\nMy colleague was hired to help accelerate development of the project in academia, with the hope that he would also be a good co-founder when it came time to spin out. Rather than specialize in business, he has specialized in being a technical innovator, and combined with his natural creativity, has made significant improvements to the product. However, he has been very feature development-oriented, so for example is very good at developing new algorithms to solve specific problems but requires assistance integrating them into the broader software suite in a scalable and sustainable way. Put another way, what he works on would be great for a service-based business model if he manually solves client problems, but he needs another developer (me) to turn it into a product that people other than him can actually use.\n\nTo be candid, there does feel like there is a hierarchical deferred responsibility attitude present; he is, in some ways and some times, the \"idea guy\" who brings up ideas like \"the product should do this\" but for things that are out of both of our expertise, seems to wait for it to \"happen\" instead of going out of his way to learn a new skill set. And since historically I have been the \"lead,\" it naturally seems to fall on me to figure out. This does not happen if it is something new in his niche of expertise; he is very good at tunneling deeper. Rather, if for example he's never worked on getting his code to run on a remote server, he seems to have a hard time figuring out where to even get started, let alone execute on it. So it remains \"we should do this ...\" instead of \"I started working on this.\"\n\nFinally, over the years there have been several attempts to evaluate his ability to supervise hourly workers, and he has expressed multiple times that this does not come naturally to him and while he is able to assign work for certain projects, the impression has been that he operates more like a task-assigner than a mentor. There have been several instances where I have had to step in to \"adopt\" his supervisees to meet both project needs and their personal development needs.\n\nAt face value if evaluated now, I would not consider this a 50/50 partnership. Business development falls almost solely on my shoulders, while at the same time I am also responsible for developing technical aspects of the product that fall outside of my co-founder's niche. While he is on paper qualified to be a CTO, the apparent shortfalls in the kinds of expertise or initiative-taking needed to be an autonomous technical lead, combined with mediocre leadership skills, cast a shadow over such. All of that said, he has grown a lot especially in the last year, and I like to maintain a growth mindset, not a fixed one. Who knows where he'll be in 5 years, and how much more he can and will do.\n\n**Question:**\n\nThis ambiguity about the future makes it hard to establish an equity split that is both fair and also motivating to everyone involved. I would like to be 50/50 in 5 years, but if the trajectories and responsibilities more or less stay the same as they are now (i.e., if I \"handle\" all of the other stuff and there is not a huge need for him to grow), then I would be bearing a lot more weight for an equal share of ownership.\n\nWe will operate as is customary: 4 year vesting, 1 year cliff and all that. So it's not set in stone and we technically start with 0/0 anyway. My question is: what are the systems or mechanisms that people have put in place to systematically deal with this kind of situation? From what I understand, the vesting and cliff are mostly designed to protect the cap table if someone quits, but what is the impact of clawing back someone's equity while they're still working and still a co-founder if they fail to live up to expectations, both on the business (i.e., legal costs of making the change) and on founder psyche? Alternatively, is there a way to set it up so that we each start with say 30% allocated on the cap table (at 4yr vest, 1yr cliff), and then get additional allocation based on performance in a year, etc.?\n\nThe point of contention is that the psychological impact of an unequal allocation (like 60/40) weighs on him, and may create a negative feedback loop/self-fulfilling prophecy where just the knowledge of unequal positions on the cap table makes him less motivated to give 110% effort, in the same way that having 50/50 allocation gives me pause to work full-time and do both tech and business development while he works part-time while finishing his degree.",
    "comments": [
      "To me, the problem is who is the arbiter of what he is living up to.  For example, you could start out with restricted shares each of 50/50 with vesting, four year vesting, six month cliff, and then monthly vesting for the remainder.  This will then force you two to have a MONTHLY check in if he is tracking to his 50% ownership target.  If he isn't, you can have discussions on what he needs to be doing to earn the full 50%.\n\nThat might cause some complexity on who decides if he is entitled to his next tranche, what happens if he doesn't \"earn\" that next tranche (can he \"re-earn\" it the next month?  Do you give him the tranche but write up an action plan for the next month?) and if he isn't hitting his milestones will he then be unhappy and leave because he disagrees with your evaluation of his contributions and 60/40 is problematic for him? \n\nAlso, what happens if the company starts to get hugely successful and you decide to be a bad actor and tell him he's not performing up to the level needed because you don't want him taking what is now equity that equates to real money.\n\nSo, who is in control?  What happens if you disagree?  \n\nYou are basically saying that the vesting is both time based (easy) and performance based (always really hard to define)......it's a good puzzle.\n\nSimple one is to go 51/49, you both vest (I like my cliff and schedule better because it forces a monthly evaluation), and you do the check-ins and manage expectations together.  This works really well when it works and he grows into the role.  It doesn't work as well if he feels he is doing what he needs to do to vest and you disagree.  Then he either has to live with that or leave.  \n\nSource:  I'm the [www.captableexpert.com](http://www.captableexpert.com) and have seen just about every fucked up cap table in the world.

      "Deferred equity splits can work but they're risky and often create more problems than they solve. The uncertainty usually causes more tension over time, not less.\n\n\n\nFrom what you've described, you're already thinking about this the right way - you bring the business development, market understanding, and initial tech foundation. Your cofounder brings technical innovation and product improvements. That's a solid complementary partnership.\n\n\n\nHere's what I'd suggest instead of deferring:\n\n\n\nStart with a rough 60/40 or 65/35 split in your favor based on what you've outlined. You initiated the technology, built the market relationships, and you're handling the business side. His contributions are valuable but came after the initial foundation was set.\n\n\n\nThe key is getting both of you comfortable with this now rather than creating a system where you're constantly measuring contributions. That gets messy fast and distracts from actually building the business.\n\n\n\nFew things to consider:\n\n\\- Set up vesting schedules (4 years with 1 year cliff is standard)\n\n\\- Include provisions for what happens if someone leaves or isn't performing\n\n\\- Get this documented properly with a startup lawyer\n\n\n\nYou could also consider a small equity pool (maybe 5-10%) that gets allocated based on specific milestones or achievements over the first 18 months. This gives you both some upside for exceptional contributions without the complexity of a full deferred system.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing is getting this settled so you can focus on customers and product. Equity disputes kill more startups than bad products do.\n\n\n\nWhat industry are you in? Might help with more specific advice on typical founder splits in your space."

Both of us each have 10+ year industry experience in AI. MIT, Berkeley, Google, Meta, Apple...etc. We have product, user growth and a small amount of revenue (3 digits).

These formulas wont tell you what post money valuation you should ask for, but they will help you figure out your current valuation is.

I like using all three methods and finding something in the middle that fits.  Ping me if you have any issues.",

Unless you are going to tell what you are solving, there is no way on Earth anybody will be able to comment further. \n\n\n2. Team: 2 full time people and an advisor. Strong profile but not enough. Get some more people in your team. Also you are first time founders with great experience in your corporate career. Doesn't mean that you would do well as an entrepreneur. \n\n3. Traction: don't say you have user growth and your revenue is 3 digits. When people say early user growth or early traction, they mean at least 2k-5k people paying them money. \n\nThe stage you are at is generally considered a Pre-revenue stage where you have just built an MVP to test the product out. \n\n\nQuestions that investors ask:\n1. What is the big problem you are solving? - No mention of the product. \n\n2. Why are you guys the best people/team to solve it? - Some credit here only because of the experience.assuning that you are building something that is in line with your past experience. \n\n3. What is your MOAT? Why are you different from your competition? - No mention of it. \n\n\nUnlikely any VC/Early stage fund will invest.

Then we have an algorithm that can tell you the minimum number of container moves you have to make to get an incoming container ship unloaded onto the dock, then put on trucks, and on the road.  Our special sauce is the algorithm that can plan out your entire container movement schedule to it's least number of moves so you save enormous time and money as each time you use a crane to move a container it's a lot of money\".\n\nInvestor:  \"A friend of mine has drones and he can fly it over a dock and get video of it.  Tell me how he doesn't blow you out of the water.\"\n\nMe:  This guy is a total dipshit.\n\nTrue story.  \n\nThat guy is a noted fuckwit in the angel community in my city.  \n\nI don't care if you figure out where I am or who he is or if he finds out I told that story.

They're testing whether you're self-aware enough to know what could go sideways - and honest enough to admit it.\n\nSounds like you're being smart about prepping early.

    "title": "The Social Network Fried This Generation of Founders Or The Founder Theranos Plague - I will not promote",
    "selftext": "This is going to be solely my personal opinion, and it will probably rub some founders the wrong way.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I am only going to talk about founders that have made money and are prevalently getting more and more attention. \n\nSuccessful founders (young and old) are splitting into one of four categories:\n\n1. The Cluelists\n2. The Tech Bro\n3. The Nose Down \"Autist\"\n4. The Brutalist\n\nIt's no secret that hype cycles have driven founders and investors alike to expand or alter their horizons in terms of what their thesis is, how they assess risk (or dont), and even how their internal teams are structured/ideas are executed on due to the rapid implementation and advancement of AI.\n\nWe underestimated to a degree the cultural effect of social media focused movements like Build In Public, The Hormozis, etc. have had not just on founder mentality/strategy but also how they're assessed by investors.\n\nBeyond that, you have movies like The Founder, The Social Network, The Big Short, etc. etc. motivating this newer generation of founders to essentially say and do ridiculous shit because they feel it's:  \nA. All attention can be converted to hype and thus help move the needle (which ok, some of the time or alot of it, that's true).  \nB. If they're right, the market will prove them right and all this adds to the \"lore\" of their story.\n\nTwo examples, everyone knows about Roy Lee from Cluely, about how he's the (as corny as it is to say) bad boy of SV rn running around hiring 50 interns, milking clout and having a good time doing it for the purpose of... cultivating eyeballs and attention which is a currency as long as it converts into currency.\n\nIs this anything new, or just an open and honest approach to what we've already seen a million times?\n\nAs he says, distribution is what matters.\n\nYou have Tech Bro founders on the other hand building creator/attention focused businesses like TBPN who at least provide value beyond just entertainment, and while more of them function as arm chair philsophers, the most dangerous ones in my opinion are the Gundo bros.\n\nGundo Bros are a catch 22, because they're an attempt to reinvigorate the US defense sector, which is popular right now but many of them lack the expertise or the awareness to set even remotely realistic expectations for whats achievable. And like the Cluelists, they have arrogance and freely blow through capital at insane valuations without actually having a reasonable timeline to execute anything of worth.\n\nFor instance, Rangeview is likely more years away than you'd think from having a part that is air certified to be able to use, and a majority of their work allegedly is very very bad, which is one thing, but they spend time and money posting hype videos to sell the dream, which is what you're supposed to do, only if you can deliver.\n\nWhat are the odds these companies go the way of the last generation of metal 3d printing companies? Don't know what I mean, look up Velo3d, Markforged, etc. etc. Big promises, small target, no feasibility to get there for sustained use.\n\nThe Nose Down autist is a much easier one, it only deserves a line.\u00a0Look at ScaleAI's competitor, SurgeAI, it says it all.\n\nUnlike ScaleAI, which made headlines for its Meta deal whilst still unprofitable, SurgeAI IS profitable, has NO investors, and has been \"quietly\" and quickly building more competently in the data labeling market.\n\nBig moves, consistency, quiet execution. Less hype and investor money, more profit money AND maintaining control. Not enough of these and the issue is, they're consequently harder to find especially if part of your assessment as an investor is \"traction + motion\". They work simply, don't need investors, just a good team and the right direction/timing/opportunity. You don't even hear much about their journey because their approach is more akin to Danny Postman or LevelsIo who crank product and scale intelligently albeit quickly.\n\nWhich leads me to the final type of founder I've been seeing both in my work and my research.\n\nThe Brutalist\n\nAn unrelenting, motion obsessed, revenue driving monster that takes something boring and pours an insane amount of effort into making it run up, at all costs. This type of founder will do anything to win, from acquiring competitors even only a year into operations to employing tactics that all the above use.\n\nMy favorite example lately is Grey Friend from Kashupay.\n\nWhat's weird about these ones is that they are obviously able to be tuned into the antics of everyone of the above, whilst attempting to retain and execute with the same discipline as The Nose Down Autist, and to success, but like the others, they are willing to do whatever it takes even if the substance there is is ambigous. I made another post on Reddit asking info about this example, and after a week of researching and even being able to talk to him directly, it can be encapsulated in, \"half the time, noone understand what they're doing\".\n\nI realize that legal ambiguity is a major cornerstone of new things, uber, bitcoin/crypto, etc. etc. and so those who wade in the water end up doing better as long as it isn't across the line. Look at AI itself as a focus for legislators globally that can't even figure out what to do with it, but its growing so fast, its impossible to control.\n\nThe startups that are able to grow fast, offer substance (even if you dont like it), and build relationships will win over the other options.\n\nSo, my biggest question is, will this be the norm going forward or is this a blip?\n\nIs it grifts or just smart business?",

Was Mark Zuckerberg a \"[...] Nose Down Autist\"? Was Elizabeth Holmes a \"Tech Bro\"? I feel you need to connect this back more if you want your reader to more instinctively feel the thread of the discussion.\n- You talk about how everyone knows about Roy Lee -- I didn't, and I feel like I'm fairly tuned into things in startup world. Perhaps some links and references to these people and companies you keep mentioning?\n  - In that same vein, you bring up terms or brief examples that I had to keep searching up -- \"Gundo Bros\", \"Velo3d\", etc. Perhaps instead of saying \"My favorite example lately is Grey Friend from Kashupay\", you actually outline how this person/company fits your definition?\n- Formatting is a mess here -- if you broke out a section with each type of founder under a bolded word or heading that would do wonders",

      "This deal structure has some red flags that remind me of how larger players acquire smaller companies without paying acquisition prices. I work at a consulting firm that helps early-stage founders evaluate partnership deals, and the \"license plus development funding\" approach often ends badly for the startup.\n\nHere's what's concerning about this setup:\n\nYou're essentially giving away your technology for licensing fees while building their business model. The \"potential studio investment\" in Phase 2 gives them all the leverage to lowball you later or walk away with your tech.\n\nThe revenue sharing on leads they generate puts you in a subordinate position where you're dependent on their customer acquisition efforts rather than building your own.\n\nWhat actually protects you in deals like this:\n\nLicensing should be non-exclusive with reversion rights if certain milestones aren't met. Don't give them exclusive access to your platform.\n\nDevelopment funding should convert to equity at a predetermined valuation, not just be licensing fees. This ensures you retain ownership of what you build.\n\nRevenue sharing should be time-limited with options to buy out their lead generation rights after a certain period.\n\nIP ownership stays with you for any technology developed during the licensing period. They get usage rights, not ownership.\n\nPhase 2 terms need to be pre-negotiated with minimum valuation floors and anti-dilution protections.\n\nThe brutal reality is that if your technology is valuable enough for them to want to license it, you might be better off raising traditional funding to maintain full control. Industry relationships and customer acquisition can be built over time, but giving away your core technology is usually irreversible.\n\nWhat specific leverage do they have that you can't replicate with proper funding and time?"

      "Using a throwaway account.\u00a0\n\nThe comments in the thread don't line up with what I've seen in Silicon Valley so adding a take for those that want to hear an opinion with this model. \u00a0Take this post for what it's worth but hopefully this helps someone.\u00a0\n\n1). My anecdotal opinion is that it used to be far less common and now you're seeing it more often. Not the standard but more acceptable if with good reason and clarity.\u00a0\n\n2). I asked our investors in the past and no issue if done thoughtfully / with good reason. There's enough precedence that it can work very well. There're also easy signs when it doesn't work / not going to work.\n\nFWIW, the only time it came up for us was a little bit in the seed and in the series a by one investor. Others that gave us TS in series a felt it made sense once they met us and saw throughout how we worked together. \u00a0Generally there was interest / excitement as \"it seemed to be working very well\" from back channels on us/ team / customers. Never heard about it since then.\u00a0\n\n3). Imo, neither. FWIW, a trend im seeing is comfort backing husband / wife or \"families\" (one startup I know that is killing it and got major funding is run by two families and another very very successful one that is one of the fastest growers is run by two cofounders and one of their dads). \u00a0Vcs see different things outside of \"traditional\" structures. That's not giving validation to go do something unconventional - just there's a broader appetite than what folks probably would have expected.\u00a0\n\nBuilding startups is hard. \u00a0I believe it raises the question immediately for why to understand if it was sensible / how it will help run things faster / better, etc. Like I mentioned earlier, vcs see this more often and how it can work so there's less immediate concern unless there's a reason to be concerned based on any signal. An analog is seeing a healthy marriage or bad marriage when you're with a couple - you can usually sense something is off.\u00a0\n\n4). From those that I've seen including ourselves, it's split by speciality. Product vs gtm, internal vs external facing, etc. they're usually similar, don't think ive seen many other permutations.\u00a0\n\nMy personal belief is that you see flavors of co-ceo in the world though it's less apparent to folks. I believe some extreme examples are young founder who's one \"direct report\" is the \"coo\" and the \"coo\"/serial executive who oversees the entire exec team and makes just about every decision except visionary topics. \u00a0We can debate if there was truly a ceo structure vs two CEOs but just my opinion.\u00a0\n\nFor how we make decisions, we make the final decision based on who owns the responsibility/org (\"the d\" model from Amazon). For very big decisions that are truly crossfunctional / company wide - it's from both of us. There's a lot more to the sausage making but answering simply.\u00a0\n\n5). \u00a0Not sure all the reasons for others but for us, building a startup is hard and we wanted to focus/do things that was in service of making it easier. In the beginning, when we were \"figuring out our roles\" phase, we genuinely believed as cofounders we were seeing each other as equal. We felt it was complicating things by trying to force ourselves into societal constructs (\"do you want to be the ceo? \u00a0You should because you like talking to clients and this will help\". \"Which one of us should be making the final decision for anything. Do I report to you?). We agreed that this seemed unfair given how we wanted to operate/make decisions especially since we are supposed to be in charge of our own company togethe and we should be able to run the business we felt made sense to us and make it go fast.\n\nHope that helps.\u00a0\n\nSource: \u00a0we've been running our business for several years and over a few hundred ftes backed by traditional venture capital through several series.\u00a0",

I have always stumbled on the question that how this thing works.\nThe question is like lets saya company is sold by a founder ( especially for software startups ) to an investor, then what guarantees the investor that the founder will not make this company again with just a little different name. \n\nIs there also some kind of contract that nothing like this can be done again? Because the fiunder can easily rebuild that company again as he has created it before so?\n\nOr is it like the founder just don't work again or ge just goes to some different idea?\n\n\n2. Got a question from writing above: have you guys experienced like having an idea then even after seeing that it is applicable and scalable but just after a specific time all the hope for thar project is gone. Like it feels like that is just a rubbish idea. \nThis should not be a rubbish idea because just a little before everything about it was looking good. I have experienced this many times. Have you guys experienced this? If yes then how to tackle this? Asking from someone else could be good but it feels like I am surrounded by people who like to limit their approaches and ideas so it doesnt go good.....\n\n\nLooking forward to your advices!\nThanks for your time!\n",

      "Yeah, when a company gets acquired, there's usually a non-compete clause that stops the founder from spinning up the same thing again, it\u2019s pretty standard. But honestly, after the first time, I didn't want to build the same thing, twas time for a new challenge. And on losing faith in ideas, been there. Sometimes it\u2019s just burnout talking, not the idea",
      "Generally if the company is smart they'll put a non compete clause which ties their hand for 5 years or whatever. So the founders generally just become a part of the company. Instagram's founders worked with facebook before they left and so did Oculus's founder too.",

If the founder leaves, they will often sign a non-compete.

      "What is a general operator in a startup company? What do they do? Never heard of it. Is it like chief of staff?",
      "The operator role search is definitely tricky because the titles are all over the place. Companies call these roles everything from \"Head of Operations\" to \"Business Operations Manager\" to \"Chief of Staff\" to \"VP Operations\" - sometimes the exact same responsibilities under totally different titles.\n\n\n\nFew things that helped when I was hiring for these types of roles at Twine:\n\n\n\nLinkedIn search wise - try searching for combinations like \"startup operations\", \"business operations\", \"head of operations\", \"VP ops\", \"chief of staff\", \"general manager\" etc. Also search by company stage (Series A, Series B) since thats usually when these broader operator roles really matter.\n\n\n\nThe YC job board is good but limited. [Angel.co](http://Angel.co) (now Wellfound) tends to have more operator-focused roles. Also check out the job boards on places like First Round, a16z careers pages - lots of their portfolio companies post there.\n\n\n\nHonestly though, your best bet might be going direct to companies you're interested in. Most startups in that 50-500 employee range desperately need someone with your background but might not have posted the role yet or might not even realize they need to hire for it.\n\n\n\nYour logistics + ERP implementation experience is actually pretty valuable right now. Lots of companies are dealing with supply chain mess and need someone who understands both the systems side and operational execution.\n\n\n\nWorth reaching out to founders/CEOs directly on LinkedIn mentioning your ops background. Even if they're not actively hiring, they'll likely know other founders who are.\n\n\n\nWhat stage/size companies are you targeting? That might help narrow down the search approach.",

    "title": "Stuck on \"What to do now\" after building a data analytics platform with specialized agents - I will not promote",
    "selftext": "Hey all!\n\n**I feel like dark clouds are gathering above our heads because we either lack clarity or don't see enough progress to keep going. It's a tough place to be, but pretty much every entrepreneur suffers from this. So here I am, looking for a piece of bread, I mean, validation!**\n\nImagine plugging your company data into a tool and instead of scrolling through a jungle of dashboards and noodle charts early in the morning, you simply type in \"Who's the most profitable employee this month?\" and go grab yourself a cup of coffee.\n\nYou come back and you have an answer, an action plan, and forecasts right in front of you, all while sipping on that dark-as-night coffee that would make a steed kick the bucket with its caffeine content.\n\nAt least that's the \"marketing\" part of the tool. I'm looking for insights and advice on how it could grow and where else to apply it.\n\nIn general, it's a platform that currently uses our company data as the primary data set. It has several integrations like Jira, Everhour, Sendgrid, and some book-keeping software to pull salaries and other related data. We have data charts to visualize all of this data, but the highlight is that you can chat with an AI agent to pull specific data for you.\n\nUnder the hood, we have developed several agents. Like worker agents, QA agents, reasoning agents, calculation agents, etc. These agents can then choose from a variety of tools that interact with said integrations.\n\nOne tool may pull Jira data and combine it with Everhour tracked time, while the other tool may calculate revenue, profits, margins, and make a forecast based on the efficiency of any employee.\n\nThe AI here is like a director of smaller, more specialized AI agents who have access to tools or functions. And the final result is then returned to the user.\n\nOn top of that, we have added periodical analyses. Let's say you may ask the AI to \"Generate a report of who tracked the most time and worked on the most Jira tickets. Send it to me every day at 5 pm\". This would trigger an analysis generator agent that would schedule a job that generates said report and sends it to you via email.\n\nSo far, it's been great using it internally, and I see a lot of potential going into different industries like e-commerce, logistics, or some SMBs. We have even started working on preparing a demo on how it would integrate with one of the most used bookkeeping software in the country, known for its archaic complexity and rampant confusion.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIs it something that has potential, or am I just working on a \"pretty cool\" tool with barely any use case?",
    "comments": [
      "Long story short: You've made up a nice sounding scenario, but haven't shown any ability to execute to a level giving proven results over a wide variety of applications.\n\nIt's like those smart mirrors that everyone started building years ago. At first it sounded awesome with your mirror in the morning giving you all the information to get your day started and planned just right. But in the end it was just an expensive display/mirror that showed a weather widget and a subscribed calendar. Fun sounding idea, but the fantasy/sci-fi died when it was implemented.\n\nI feel that it's the same here. You've got the idea, you're talking about integrations, but in the end it's just that you've got the idea to build \"something something AI\".\n\nYes, I did see that you said that it works great internally. But, you know, there's a huge chasm of a leap between an internal tool working for your setup, to a commercially viable service. So the proof in whether or not this is a useful tool lies completely in whether or not it actually works as a commercially viable solution after you've tried to build that.\n\nMy guess would be that you'll find that your custom implementations won't scale well enough to work independently. Making it much much more expensive than expected to take this from what works internally, to actually being a scalable service.\n\nYour post is at its core not more than \"AI could \\[\u2026\\]\", and you need to narrow that down to what you'd actually build, and then prove that you can build that without it losing its magic along the way.\n\nI'd say that you should go build this for free for 10 companies, of very different types, with very different types of people working there, with very different needs and wants, and targeting very different markets, to prove to yourself (and after that to investors) that you can take your concept and build a scalable startup out of it.",

      "Approach the problem backwards. Don\u2019t start with \u201chere\u2019s this cool tool I have (that does everything), how do I sell it\u201d. Focus on one integration and then brainstorm all the ways businesses could get value from insights into that data and build a marketing strategy that way.\u00a0\n\nExample: reduce jira ticket times, distribute jira workload better, etc. find something that needs addressing and position your product as a way to do that.\u00a0",
      "I am actually building out the data analytics side of my startup, so this caught my interest. So in building my product, I am designing raw data collection to record all meaningful (and some not) events. I am working with my data analyst to figure out how to approach turning data into business intelligence. \n\nReading what you described, what comes to mind is that I don't actually need or want a free-thinking AI analyst that can provide all sorts of reports on demand. What I want is being able to build useful reports but those reports are set in stone once built, and only upper management get to question/change it. As operations grow, mid to lower level employees should have clear instructions to follow. So the reports need to be custom built once and standardized for others. I do not want middle managers and workers to chat with my data, I want them to have clear instructions to perform their pre-defined functions.\n\nI would enjoy using such a tool, but only once in a while when I need to make strategic decisions. So currently I ask my data analyst business questions and they will design the queries and reports. \n\nSo I think the function is valuable, but not needed for most levels of management and not a recurring need.",
      "You've built something that could be fucking valuable, but you're stuck in the classic \"cool tech looking for a problem\" trap. The multi-agent approach is solid - that's where the industry is heading - but your positioning is all over the place.\n\nHere's the reality check: \"chat with your data\" isn't a market category anymore. Every BI tool and their grandmother has added AI chat features. Your differentiation is the specialized agent orchestration, but you're not leading with that.\n\nWorking at a firm that specializes in AI strategy for mid-sized companies, I see this pattern constantly. You've got three paths forward:\n\n1. Pick ONE vertical and go deep. E-commerce analytics is oversaturated. Logistics has potential - trucking companies, 3PLs, and freight brokers are drowning in data from different systems. Your agent approach could actually solve the \"data lives in 12 different places\" problem better than traditional dashboards.\n2. Focus on the scheduling/automation angle. That \"send me a report every day at 5pm\" feature is more valuable than the chat interface. Most executives don't want to ask questions - they want insights delivered proactively.\n3. Target the \"terrible legacy software\" angle. That bookkeeping integration you mentioned? That's your wedge. Find industries stuck with shitty, non-integrated software and become the AI layer that makes sense of it all.\n\nThe mistake our clients make is trying to be everything to everyone. You need to find companies where the pain of manually correlating data across systems costs them real money - like construction companies tracking projects across accounting, scheduling, and procurement systems.\n\nStop calling it a \"data analytics platform.\" Position it as \"AI-powered business intelligence automation\" or something that speaks to the outcome, not the tech stack.\n\nYour multi-agent architecture is actually ahead of most competitors, but nobody gives a shit about your architecture. They care about getting answers without doing work.",
      "You've built something that's actually useful but honestly, you're describing a pretty crowded market with established players like Tableau, Looker, and dozens of AI-powered analytics tools. I work at a consulting firm that helps companies evaluate business intelligence platforms, and the \"chat with your data\" concept is everywhere right now.\n\nThe multi-agent architecture is technically interesting, but most business users don't give a shit about the underlying complexity. They want answers to questions, and there are already tools that do this reasonably well.\n\nWhat you need to figure out fast:\n\nYour competitive differentiation beyond \"AI agents that analyze data.\" Every BI tool is adding conversational interfaces now. What makes yours better than asking questions in Microsoft Copilot or Tableau's natural language features?\n\nSpecific industry pain points that existing tools don't solve. The bookkeeping software integration you mentioned might be your angle if it's truly archaic and other tools don't handle it well.\n\nWhether businesses will pay enough to justify your development costs. SMBs are notoriously cheap about analytics tools, and enterprises already have expensive BI platforms they're locked into.\n\nYour go-to-market strategy. How do you get customers when they already have dashboards and reporting tools that sort of work?\n\nThe fact that it works well internally is a good sign, but internal tools often don't translate to market demand. Your team has specific data analysis needs that might not be common elsewhere.\n\nStop building more features and start talking to potential customers outside your company. Find out if they have the same problems you're solving and whether they'd pay to fix them.\n\nThe \"pretty cool tool with barely any use case\" scenario is unfortunately common. Figure out the market fit before you burn more runway on technical improvements.",
      "This sounds like a really solid product! The multi-agent approach with specialized AI agents is smart - way more reliable than trying to make one agent do everything.\n\n\n\nI can totally relate to that \"dark clouds\" feeling. As a founder myself, I've been there multiple times where you're not sure if you should keep pushing or pivot. That uncertainty is brutal.\n\n\n\nFrom what you've described, it sounds like you've built something genuinely useful. The ability to just ask \"who's the most profitable employee\" and get back actionable insights instead of digging through dashboards is exactly what busy founders need.\n\n\n\nA few thoughts on growth:\n\n\\- Your current integrations (Jira, Everhour, etc) suggest you're targeting tech companies initially, which makes sense\n\n\\- The periodic reporting feature is gold - that's recurring value that keeps people engaged\n\n\\- Consider expanding to other data sources that these same companies use (maybe CRM data, marketing analytics, etc)\n\n\n\nFor validation, have you tried reaching out to other founders in your network? Even just 5-10 conversations could give you clarity on whether this resonates. Sometimes we're too close to our own product to see how valuable it really is.\n\n\n\nThe fact that you've built working multi-agent architecture puts you ahead of most AI tools out there that are just GPT wrappers. That's real differentiation.\n\n\n\nWhat specific metrics are you using to measure progress right now? Sometimes the \"lack of progress\" feeling comes from not tracking the right things.\n\n\n\nhang in there - building something this technical takes time but you're solving a real problem that every data-driven company has.",
      "Interesting perspective. Always valuable to see different viewpoints on these topics.",
      "Building a data analytics platform with those features sounds super exciting! The idea of having AI agents that can pull specific insights must make decision-making so much easier. I can totally relate to that feeling of being stuck or uncertain about the next steps in such a complex landscape. \n\n\n\nHave you thought about how tools like Natural Language Processing could enhance user interaction? At [WonderShark.ai](http://WonderShark.ai), we\u2019re passionate about streamlining operations too, and I\u2019ve seen how powerful data management can be in supercharging productivity. Integrating those AI agents with business operations could create some amazing capabilities, especially if it\u2019s used in industries like e-commerce or logistics. \n\n\n\nCurious to see how your platform evolves!

    "selftext": "Hundreds of new SaaS products launch every day with websites built from the same blueprint: sterile, Apple-like aesthetics, prominent PRICING labels in the header, and overcomplicated CTAs that promise everything and deliver nothing.\n\nPeople are getting weary and losing trust. Do you really think everyone is collecting infinite subscriptions or buying infinite tokens for AI services that disappear as fast as they appear?\n\nWhere is the substance, the real gain, in building tools that exist just to help you build more tools so more \u201cfounders\u201d can launch more AI toys?\n\nTwitter and Reddit are flooded with posts like\u00a0*\u201cI made $100K out of thin air in a couple of months with my SaaS and I can tell you how for a price,\u201d \u201cMy new SaaS can tell you if your SaaS is valuable,\u201d \u201cMy SaaS can create fake visitors for your SaaS,\u201d \u201cI vibe-coded a SaaS that improves your SaaS SEO,\u201d \u201cI was tired of thinking for myself so I vibe-coded a SaaS that does it for you,\u201d*\u00a0and so on.\n\nIt\u2019s full of SaaS bros saying,\u00a0*\u201cBro, it is so easy to make a living creating and selling SaaS. I\u2019m bro-coding my third SaaS while selling the second for $200K, easy bro, easy.\u201d*\n\nI\u2019ve looked into the profiles of these self-proclaimed \u201cSaaS gurus\u201d who claim to be doing amazing things by launching a new SaaS every four months. What I found were lots of insecure man-children who swore NFTs and memecoins were the future four years ago; people who repeat the same success stories again and again but run and hide when you ask basic questions about their products; and tons of folks playing at being successful \u201cfounders\u201d because living a fake online life feels better.\n\nFor each of them, there are a thousand gullible simps claiming it has never been easier to make a full-time living by vibe-coding SaaS solo and pointing to \u201ctons of examples\u201d of founders selling their tools like hotcakes.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying nobody has built a successful AI-driven product and made real money. I\u2019ve followed genuine cases of people who hit the jackpot in record time. But statistically, it\u2019s impossible for everyone to be doing so well. Given human nature, the ratio of fakers to genuine successes is huge, and those desperate to prove their achievements only erode trust because real winners don\u2019t crave validation and they aren\u2019t begging for attention in subreddits; they\u2019re being interviewed by specialized media.\n\nIs it easier than ever to create an online product that sells? Yes, I believe that. But competition is fiercer than ever. Ninety percent of founders are creating products to sell to other founders, watering down the AI bubble. Frontends and monetization models all start to look the same, breeding doubt and distrust.\n\nPersonally, with the help of AI, I built and automated a website offering a genuine service that now generates modest revenue through ads and subscriptions. I didn\u2019t brand it as an AI tool; it looks and feels like a legacy-style service. My users aren\u2019t other developers but a specific niche of non-technical people. I\u2019ve been working on it for months and keep optimizing it. I want to distance my site from the current Apple-like \u201cclean\u201d aesthetics and startup jargon. I don\u2019t want to develop for other developers at all. My goal is not to inflate the AI bubble but to use AI behind the scenes and earn a side income.\n\nI\u2019ve studied REAL cases of mega-successful AI startups sold for BIG money: an eco-app that calculates the carbon footprint of any online purchase, a system that translates haute couture sketches into 3D runway-ready models, a cost-efficient platform that finds the best supplier for small and medium food chains, and so on. Notice anything in common? Their purpose is not to build or market more AI tools. They target very specific niche problems far outside the \u201cfounder/dev\u201d echo chamber.\n\n*^(---------------\\[I will not promote, ok?\\])*",

      "I appreciate the insightful perspective you've shared. You raise some valid concerns about the proliferation of SaaS products and AI services that may be more hype than substance. As a custom software development company focused on AI, I agree that the true value comes from solving specific, niche problems rather than simply building tools for other founders. The most successful AI-driven products tend to target underserved markets and offer tangible benefits to end-users, not just other developers. Your approach of using AI behind the scenes to deliver a practical service aligns with this principle. Maintaining a grounded, customer-centric focus is key to cutting through the noise and building something truly valuable.",

It's not just about tech know-how, but also how well they can collaborate and convey their ideas. A lightweight tracking tool for evaluating these skills sounds like a game changer. We\u2019ve had success integrating soft skill assessments into our workflow at [WonderShark.ai](http://WonderShark.ai), which has helped us get better alignments in project teams.

I'll share the full idea in the comments if you're curious, but right now I'm at a bit of a decision point in terms of how I want to move forward with it. So here's the situation:\n\nI\u2019m already coding this thing myself so it is getting built no matter what. But from a company-building perspective, I\u2019m at a fork in the road. I don't have the luxury (read: time or savings) to spend several months building it out completely for free (in terms of taking over all functions a startup requires, not just pure coding), hoping something materializes later. So I\u2019m thinking I have two real options:\n\n* Option A: Try to raise funding early, even pre-product, based on the concept, some prototypes, and the bigger vision\n\n* Option B: Just open-source the project (either right away or if raising doesn\u2019t work out), that way I can still share the work and have a dope new repo on my git with what I think is a more-than-decent idea\n\nSo I'm trying to feel out: what makes sense here?\n\n1) What do you usually do when you hit a crossroad like this? How do you decide whether to push toward raising or go the open-source/community route? (general question)\n\n2) Does this approach make sense to you?

Horizontal development: Having a very lean horizontal set-up, where you build a MVP for every process step up front and continue to develop all of the features at once as you grow your team. \n\n2. Vertical development: Build one step REALLY well, the one you dying for the most, and then add step after step gradually.\n\nPersonally? I'd take 2! Because many times ideas start like this, a very broad, big idea and then the founder(s) realize that even a small part of it works so well they decide to focus on just that.

It can help a lot with distribution in the right market. I don\u2019t see how it would help with influencer marketing.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t consider raising until you have a concrete plan for getting traction. Having a better product is not enough. It sounds like you are building a two sided marketplace which is significantly harder to get going.\n\nI\u2019m considering open sourcing part of my product right now so I can tell you my thought process:\n\nI sell to devs, so OSS definitely helps with word of mouth, goodwill, etc. But my core product is not OSS because there\u2019s not a way to do that which is in everyone\u2019s best interest. It would require compromises like open core and make it harder to fund the project. But there\u2019s a part that I can open source. So I\u2019m looking at how much traffic that could bring in, what conversion rates to expect, etc. and seeing if it\u2019s worth the extra effort. In my case it\u2019s maybe an extra few weeks of work and it gives me the initial traction I need, while also helping to clarify my main product\u2019s positioning, so it\u2019s worth it.",

I feel it's a good way to get a feedback from real investors about my pitch deck and the idea in general.\n\nProblem: I know investors invest in\u00a0*teams*, not the ideas. And this is where I fall short. I am basically nobody, with no industry experience, no fancy university degrees and no previous startup track record.  \nI suppose the first advice would be to \"find a cofounder with pedigree\", but it's not working for me for a few reasons. I don't have networking in this industry. The topic I\u2019m working on makes it difficult to find interested people. And also, no experienced cofounder is likely to join someone with no credentials and no funding.  \nI am planning to attend a local events related to startups and look there, but, honestly, I don't want to pick someone I just met, as a cofounder.\n\nQuestion: What should someone in this situation write in the\u00a0*Team*\u00a0section of a pitch deck?

      "Well, technically they don't invest in multiple people as much as in the project's likelihood to succeed. And with a team of dedicated people there's more of everything from time to spend to knowledge and different personalities more suitable for different tasks, and so on. And you can lose perhaps 1 out of 3 people without the project crashing, while losing 1 out of 1 people means that the project could tank simply because of a serious case of the flu or covid.\n\nSo don't focus too much on what you're lacking, as if that's the exact thing that's needed, instead focus on how you can present the strongest case possible for how it is a good investment opportunity with low risk. So what are the other ways that you can minimize the risks associated with being a solo founder?\n\nIt isn't \"Team: nobody\", it's \"Team: The amazing you\". In combination with your plan for how to grow from that single person that's you. It's how you in the shortest period of time add the structure and resilience that makes the project less reliant on just you.\n\nThis could involve things like how you intend to build your board of directors, board of advisors, as well as your plan for hiring people, your personal and professional network, and so on.\n\nIt could be anything really, it just has to help show less risk, and a greater opportunity.",

      "I'll add my two cents here, coming from the private funding space, to build on what u/already_tomorrow said, because what they said is the correct answer overall. In the private space, though, there's one or two tweaks.\n\nThere is a certain amount of interest in the project's success, and the people are essential to that success. In the private sector, though, funding sources want to ensure they're working with a team that follows through on the project and makes it a success. So that means, as a very broad example, if you are building cars, they want to see someone who has experience building cars or managing a team that has done that successfully. \n\nIf you're the only member of the team and you don't have those traits mentioned above, mention in your deck and business plan that you are going to be bringing on those people to your team, and that's one of the purposes you have in mind when raising funds. There is typically a section in business plans and pitch decks called \"Use of Funds,\" and that's one section where you can mention that some of the funds you raise will be to bring in team members to fill the gaps your company has in terms of personnel. Again, as u/already_tomorrow said, \"It isn't 'Team: nobody', it's 'Team: The amazing you'\" (Great line btw!)\n\nKeep in mind that if you have anyone that is helping you and is willing to be put on your pitch deck and/or business plan, such as advisors, board of director members, consultants, etc. to lend weight to the team you ultimately want to build, then getting their permission to be added as well as any documentation that states the fact that they are willing to be in that type of role will go a long away in your due diligence when fundraising. It would be a bit strange if you put them on your deck, then the funding sources look into them to only find they had no idea they were a part of your \"team\". You definitely need to put yourself in your deck as the Owner/CEO of the company if that is what your title will be.\n\nIf you'd like to have your pitch deck professionally reviewed by my team, please DM me, and we can review it for you free of charge.",
      "I am a solo founder, and I have run into this issue. If you are credible, driven, know your space, and have a vision they can buy into, and appear to have the drive to make it happen, then continue.

Some investors have their cookie-cutter checkboxes about co-founders, but even in a business with co-founders, there is usually one who drives it forward. Be that person.",

Hiring an experienced co founder goes a long way and it does not end with this presentation. Let's say that Im willing to be your co founder and I own multiple businesses which were all founded by me. The experience of owning those businesses would be at your arsenal of weapons you can use. As the founder, you are naturally inclined that you would be the one to hold the knife. But, there are also founders that focus on just building the product and letting their co founder handle everything outside of it. Find out whether you wanna be the one holding the knife or do you wanna be the knife. There also those that can do both and I am one of those. A term you can use to define them is a \"Generalist\".

Your cost for user acquisition and average value of user will be crap because you keep churning users (once they find the job, they won\u2019t return unless they need a new job).

You're building a tool that violates terms of service for most major job sites.\n\n**It creates an arms race.** Companies will just implement stricter filtering to combat automated applications, making it harder for everyone to get through.\n\n**The value proposition is backwards.** Good candidates don't need to apply to hundreds of jobs. They need better targeting and personalization, not more volume.\n\nWhat actually works for job seekers:\n\nTargeted applications with genuine customization based on company research.\n\nNetworking and referrals, which still account for most successful hires.\n\nBuilding skills and portfolio projects that demonstrate competency.\n\nYour \"charge per result\" model sounds good, but scheduled interviews from mass-application tools usually don't lead to quality matches or successful placements.\n\nInstead of automating the broken parts of hiring, consider building tools that help candidates create better applications or help companies identify quality candidates more effectively.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m a solo dev who built a SaaS with AI\u2019s help.\u00a0**I\u2019m currently getting daily visits and a small but steadily growing revenue from ads and subscriptions. The core idea is so simple that anyone could copy it over a weekend with a no-code AI-assisted tool,**\u00a0but the implementation and branding were manually optimized to the core.\n\n**USE AI ASSISTANCE, BUT DON\u2019T TRUST IT**\n\n* AI-driven tools can produce a working product in minutes, but that doesn\u2019t mean they give you an efficient backend that runs smoothly, a database schema that can handle years of data without surpassing free-tier limits, or a frontend and branding that truly boost your marketing.\n* I prototyped the backend in a single day with AI, then spent a month stress-testing and optimizing every edge case. Now that script runs every 15 minutes on Render\u2019s free tier, fetching, filtering and processing all my data without breaking a sweat.\n* Almost nobody tweaks the database a no-code AI tool spits out, and their search engines bloat with useless junk. The AI assistants I used (I tried many) all created an automatic Node.js solution for a search engine that almost 80% of websites are using now and that is really slow and hoards tons of unnecessary data in your database. That\u2019s why I designed my own Supabase schema and built a custom search engine ready for years of data while still staying on the free plan.\n* Most AI-generated frontends look like sterile clones crowded with React plugins. I went back to zero by using Astro for static builds, Svelte islands for interactivity, not a single generic React component, plus a distinct branding layer. The result is fast, functional and very distinct from the thousands of white or black themed pages that look like perfume magazine ads from the 90s.\n\n**ASK RELEVANT QUESTIONS, BUT DON\u2019T TRUST EVERYONE OR CRAVE VALIDATION**\n\n* Keeping the project in stealth mode was crucial. I didn\u2019t post every line of code to\u00a0/dev\u00a0or\u00a0/SaaS\u00a0asking for feedback. That kind of help often turns into espionage, someone forks your repo over a weekend and you\u2019re left with nothing.\n* For example, a dev launched a killer service to capture full-page screenshots of sites that update daily. Brilliant idea, but he promoted it in every developer subreddit. Who showed up? Hundreds of devs sniffing around how it works instead of the designers or marketers who would actually pay for it.\n* The trick is knowing who you\u2019re talking to. If your target is designers, go to\u00a0/Design\u00a0or creative communities; if it\u2019s restaurateurs, find chef forums or food entrepreneur groups. Sell the real benefit (forget manual screenshots, save three hours a month), not your tech stack.\n\nNowadays,\u00a0**almost any idea is easy to copy, but the hard part is execution, branding and maintenance.**\u00a0Work quietly, polish your backend, your database, your frontend and your branding, and get feedback from your real users, not self-proclaimed gurus in your own little puddle.\n\n*^(---------------\\[I will not promote, gosh...\\])*",

Basically: let your users, community, or industry insiders become your first investors. No form emails. No gatekeepers. And you keep control.\n\nIt works especially well when:\n\u2013 You\u2019re solving a real problem (which you clearly are)\n\u2013 You\u2019ve got usage and proof\n\u2013 You want to grow on your terms without selling the vision to suits who don\u2019t know the space\n\nI\u2019ve worked with others in construction + blue-collar SaaS\u2014DM me if you want a breakdown of what works, what to avoid, and how to keep your cap table clean if you go that route.

      "Huge respect for what you've built - you're doing what most founders never pull off: solving a problem you lived through, getting a working product out there, and hitting real traction without burning cash on ads. That's especially rare in construction tech, where half the tools feel like they were designed by people who've never held a hammer.\n\nBeing bootstrapped with 1K users and no marketing spend puts you in a killer position. You're not desperate for money - you can be picky about who you work with and what terms you take.\n\nFor outreach, cold emails can work, but you've gotta be surgical about it. Skip the generic \"disrupting construction\" pitch and hit them with something concrete: \"The $15B decking market has zero visual config tools. I built one, got it patented, and 1,000 contractors are using it. Ready to scale.\" Make it feel like they're missing out, not like you need their help.\n\nWarm intros are still gold, though - try to find investors who get blue-collar businesses. Look for people who've backed vertical SaaS, trade tools, or field ops software. They'll understand why this matters instead of trying to turn you into another generic B2B play.\n\nHonestly, with your user base, equity crowdfunding could be interesting. Let your contractors and early users become part-owners. It could bring in cash, plus create these super loyal advocates who have skin in the game.\n\nI've got a list of firms and some scrappy tactics that have worked for other vertical SaaS companies in construction and trades.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently used **Stripe Atlas** to create an LLC in the US as a **non-resident** (I'm from South America). As part of the process, I had to sign up for a **virtual mailbox address** through a service called Stable.\n\nThe LLC was successfully registered in Delaware using the virtual address provided by Stable. However, I\u2019m now being asked to **upload a document as proof of my residential address in my home country**. This is required so they can file **USPS Form 1583** on my behalf, which is necessary to keep using the virtual address for my LLC.\n\nThe problem is that the documents they accept for address verification are ones I don\u2019t have:\n\n* **Lease agreement** (None)\n* **Insurance policy** (I don\u2019t have one)\n* **Mortgage or deed** (None)\n* **Vehicle registration** (I don\u2019t own a car)\n* **Voter card** (This doesn\u2019t exist in my country)\n\nI tried uploading my driver\u2019s licence, but it was rejected. I also asked whether bank statements, utility bills, or tax documents would be acceptable. All were declined.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m not sure what to do. I don\u2019t have any of the documents they\u2019re asking for, and it seems like I might be forced to shut down the LLC because I can\u2019t keep using the virtual mailbox address.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nThanks so much in advance.\n\n  \nEDIT: My virtual mailbox address is different than my Registered Agent's address. It's just used as a mailbox forwarding service.",
    "comments": [
      "Sorry to hear you're having a tough time with this! \n\nI wish there was an easy answer, but for anyone with a virtual mailbox in the United States (regardless of the provider), the USPS Form 1583 is required. It serves two roles: ID verification using a form of valid (current) Photo ID and Address ID, and an agreement between you and your subscribed address. The business cannot accept nor even touch your mail without it.\n\nThe easiest way to explain what the form even is is you're proving, \"I am who I say I am, and the staff at this address have my permission to handle my mail.\" If you have a business and include it on the form it's more, \"I am who I say I am, this is my business and I take responsibility for its mail, and the staff at this address have my permission to handle my mail.\" The business you subscribe with then has to turn around and provide that form to the USPS, and audits where it's found that they have not done so can result in that address not receiving mail for all their customers, not just you.\n\nThere's a *bit* of a silver lining here, but it's not an ideal one. Because the USPS Form 1583 is an agreement between you and the site where your mail is handled and not you and the service you choose as a whole, you might be able to find a smaller provider or address who will risk being more flexible with accepting alternative documents. That's a case-by-case basis thing, and you'd be in a position where if your provider changed their mind and wanted valid documentation, you wouldn't be in a position to argue otherwise.\n\n\\----\n\nDepending on your living situation, if you have an informal rental agreement with someone and are paying rent, there are templates online for establishing a lease between you and the landlord.",
      "Yeah, USPS is pretty strict with Form 1583. One ID has to show your physical residential address, and not all documents count. If your license doesn\u2019t show your address, some people have luck with a utility bill, bank letter, or even a notarized affidavit of residency. That said, each mail provider can have their own stricter rules, so it\u2019s best to ask them directly what they\u2019ll accept. If you\u2019re stuck, it might be worth reaching out to a business attorney or international tax pro for guidance.",
      "Yup as others have mentioned, there's not much that they can do as it is per USPS guidelines and not the company's guidelines. You can talk to your provider about it and see if there's any options/alternatives that he or she can guide you thru to see it resolve. Other than that, the alternative would be getting an insurance policy or getting a lease with a friend to satisfy the conditions.",
      "Think about what\u2019s the cheapest way you can get one of those documents. So you live with family?  They can sign a lease agreement with you. Does life insurance count as insurance?  Should be very cheap to get a low value life insurance policy and then cancel it after your business is up and running. What\u2019s the cheapest vehicle you could purchase and register (and possibly re-sell afterwards)?",
      "I responded already in a different sub.  Looks like this was posted to a few subs.  You can get  Non-Owner Car Insurance but most people just get a letter from whomever allows them to live where they do and I often notarize it.  It not only works well but it's legal and follows all the rules.  Keep in mind the USPS 1583 is a federal document so it's not something you want to make a materially false statement on.  That could certainly result in a sudden closer of the box.  People seem to think incorrectly that they are in the green once the box is open, I have it on  excellent authority that they close boxes down all the time due to false info and other reasons.

The \"we're good at what we do but can't find an idea\" problem is super common but there's a fundamental flaw in the approach.\n\n\n\nHere's the hard truth: starting with a \"cool idea\" almost always leads to failure. The right approach flips the script completely:\n\n\n\n1. Find a painful problem that a specific group of people are actively trying to solve RIGHT NOW. Not a \"wouldn't it be nice if\" problem, but a \"I'm actively googling/paying for solutions\" problem.\n\n\n\n2. Talk to those people BEFORE writing a single line of code or building anything. Not surveys (they rarely work well for validation), but actual conversations where you can ask \"why is this important?\" and \"what have you tried?\"\n\n\n\n3. Create the simplest possible thing that solves their problem and see if they'll pull out their credit card. Thats the only real validation.\n\n\n\nGiven your fintech/payments background, you have a HUGE advantage. Look at the problems you witnessed firsthand at PayPal or in your previous business. What frustrated merchants? What made compliance a nightmare? What took way too long to implement?\n\n\n\nI learned this the hard way after wasting months on random ideas nobody wanted. When I finally focused on a painful problem I had firsthand experience with, things changed dramatically. My business (Scattermind) went from 0 to profitability quickly because I was solving a problem people were actively trying to fix.\n\n\n\nMy advice: \n\n\\- Look at problems in fintech/payments that you actually witnessed\n\n\\- Have 10+ conversations with potential customers in that space\n\n\\- Build something minimal to test if they'll pay\n\n\\- Iterate based on their feedback\n\n\n\nYou have the domain expertise - that's the hard part most people lack. Don't waste it chasing random opportunities.\n\n\n\n(Also unemployment might actually be a blessing here - gives you time to really dig deep instead of rushing into something)",

I work at a consulting firm that helps startups with funding strategy, and investors are being cautious about emerging market agtech, especially with geopolitical complexities.\n\nHere's what you need to focus on:\n\n**Regulatory clarity first.** Cross-border agricultural investment involves complex regulations in both Sudan and investor countries. You need legal clarity on foreign ownership of agricultural assets, currency transfer restrictions, and compliance requirements before pitching investors.\n\n**Prove the technology works locally.** Build your satellite monitoring and automation systems with local farmers first. Demonstrate actual crop yield improvements and ROI before expanding to international investment.\n\n**Start with smaller, less risky use cases.** Maybe focus on agricultural commodities trading or supply chain transparency before jumping to direct land investment.\n\n**Target the right investor types.** Look for impact investors, agricultural VCs, or emerging market funds rather than generic tech investors. Organizations like Accion Venture Lab or TLcom Capital understand the regional context better.\n\n**Build partnerships with established agribusiness companies.** Getting endorsements from companies like Glencore, Cargill, or regional agricultural firms adds credibility.\n\nFor UAE specifically, consider applying to accelerators like Flat6Labs, AstroLabs, or DIFC FinTech Hive that have connections to agricultural or emerging market investors.\n\nThe biggest challenge will be convincing investors that the operational risks in Sudan are manageable. Focus on demonstrating strong local execution before trying to scale internationally.\n\nWhat's your current stage? Do you have working technology or just the concept?",

Everything except the land and experience of course. \n\nEven if I wasn't local to the place Sudan demonstrate not only the best quality of produce but also the cheapest in the region not to mention more variety than any other country with valuable flora exclusive to it's region that you can't find anywhere else in the world (boabab and acacia gum for ex)"

However, there was no further communication or documentation regarding these stock options until today.\n\nNow, my boss has sent me a new stock option agreement stating that I will be granted common stock worth $1,000. The reason given is a recent 409A valuation, and the new agreement is said to supersede any previous stock option arrangements.\n\nThis feels like a major red flag to me, and I haven\u2019t signed the new agreement yet. I\u2019m not very familiar with how stock options work, so I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or guidance you can provide. Thanks!\n",
    "comments": [
      "I'm not even sure what they meant by \"stock options valued at $10,000\".  \n\nIs that the number of options multiplied by the strike price?  \n\nDid they give you options that were $10K \"in the money\" at time of grant?\n\nNow they said you are getting COMMON STOCK worth $1,000.\n\nStock vs Option grants are not the same thing AT ALL.  It's possible it's better.  It's possible it's worse.  It's possible you have tax implications.\n\nYou need someone to look at your original offer letter with the options and then look at this new document for the shares.  Too many unknowns here to give you an answer without seeing the documents.\n\nSource:  I am the www.captableexpert.com.  I can tell you what's going on and I'm way cheaper than a lawyer.",
      "Agree, check paperwork. Also ask them to explain the difference between what was offered, and now.  It feels weird to me if you don\u2019t have something in your offer letter confirming your grant. \n\nAlso know, whether it\u2019s $1k or $10k, they aren\u2019t really worth anything.\n\nThis also indicates, to me, something is happening. New round of funding, down round, acquisition, etc.  Feels like they are cleaning up the cap table. \n\nI\u2019d push pretty hard to understand the whole story. They more they avoid or give vague answers, or try to tell you everything is good, the more sus it sounds.\n\nAlso, remember, everyone above you has more shares and they are greedy to make sure they get theirs, they generally don\u2019t care about yours at all.\n\nIt could all be a good thing, just be mindful.",
      "Here\u2019s how startup equity works (usually, but check your equity agreement, hopefully attached to your offer letter):\n\n1. The shares aren\u2019t officially yours until the board approves them. \n\n2. Board meetings usually happen ~quarterly, but sometimes approving grants doesn\u2019t make it onto the agenda for various reasons, so it could be months before your shares are approved.\n\n3. There are a few things that can freeze the cap table, such as new funding rounds, if the 409a is out of date, etc. Usually no new grants are approved while the cap table is frozen.\n\n4. Your strike price is probably frozen at the fair market value \u201cwhen the grants are processed.\u201d Meaning, if they made the offer at the old valuation but approved it at the new valuation, you\u2019re locked in at the new valuation.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s weird, though. I usually see it as a %, not as a flat dollar amount. Assuming you\u2019re pre-IPO, $10,000 and $1,000 are all speculation. Either the company isn\u2019t doing great (hence the 90% drop), in which case the shares may be worthless anyway. Or there could have been a dilution event as part of a funding round. \n\nOr you got shafted and you should get a lawyer. Hard to know without seeing the paperwork.",
      "Likely worth consulting a lawyer for.\n\nAt the very least if your employment agreement mentions the quantity of the stock options grant, you have a legal right to that amount.\n\nDefinitely feels like a red flag for an agreement to \u201csupersede any previous arrangements\u201d.\n\nThe only way the 409a excuse makes sense is if the FMV of the options you received (from your offer) has somehow made them worth $1000 vs $10000 \u2026 but that\u2019s also not likely unless they were massively overvalued to begin with.",

      "My guess is they said something like \u201cyour options are worth like $10k at our last round price\u201d and the options paperwork never uses that it uses a 409a valuation which is often much lower. It used to be 10% of the last round although that is less common now. But companies try to push for low 409a valuations to keep stock option prices low because that will be the price.\n\nBut they often like to tell you that it\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d the last round price because that sounds better and is higher. But they will never write that down unless they are idiots.\n\nIt probably is worth the last round price or pretty close to that but it\u2019s complicated by preferences and other elements of the preferred stock investors get that gives it some significant advantages over the common stock employees and founders get. These things only (usually) matter in bad or neutral outcomes though. \n\nBut as others have said it\u2019s really worth nothing until the startup goes public or gets bought.z",
      "You've worked at a startup for two years without a stock option? You already got screwed.\n\nThe bare basics of stock options are that you get offered an option with your offer letter: salary, stock option + job. For a startup, the stock should be very cheap. You exercise the option and pay for the shares (with a vesting schedule yada yada yada). You then complete and file an 83b form with the IRS. This is the bare basics that you have to get right at the beginning. After that, you just keep copies of everything. Later on, you might sell the shares and have to pay taxes except that you filed an 83b right?\n\nThe chances are high that the money you spent exercising the options will be wasted. That is the nature of startups. There's also a chance that won't be. I'm retired on the basis of that.",
      "As a few others have noted, they may not have made it clear, but they probably were giving you a theoretical value based on the price of your last round (call it round X), that is number of shares / total outstanding (or hopefully fully diluted) \\* price of last round. This is the relevant price in the golden outcome case - good exit where all preferred shares convert to common and exceeding any liquidity prefs. In that case, your return will be (very very simplified, for example, ignoring subsequent rounds and dilution) be (exit price) / (price of round x) \\* (the referenced \"value\" of your options above).\n\nThe 409a will generally be priced at a substantial discount to that value for multiple reasonable factors - a) discount on value of common to preferred, and b) discounts for lack of control and marketability.\n\nNobody uses the 409a in discussing the \"value\" of shares or options, they're pretty strictly for accounting purposes. They determine the strike price in the case of options, and the value of the grant in the case of RSUs or common stock grant.\n\nAs noted by others, you're mixing terms, so it's unclear if you were granted options or stock. If stock, the discounted 409a is very important as you will owe taxes on the 409a value of your stock as they vest, so the lower the accounting valuation, the less taxes you owe out of pocket. In the case of options, it also matters, because that is how much you have to pay for each share you exercise upon exit- the higher the strike, the lower your actual profit.  Generally not as relevant at early stage, but can be very relevant for options in later stages, where the discount might be a substantial percentage of the overall return.",
      "Ask for restricted stock units by number, not value. For example 1,000 shares as opposed to $1,000. If they insist on a fixed dollar amount ask for it to be grossed up, and paid in one installment. As always seek financial advice from a professional."

You can't reliably filter synthetic data from training sets anymore.\n\n**Companies are paying premium prices for verified human-created content.** Academic datasets, licensed professional content, and curated human-generated data are becoming strategic assets.\n\n**Real-time human feedback is becoming more valuable than static datasets.** Models need ongoing human preference data to stay aligned with quality expectations.\n\nThe early signs are subtle: slight decreases in reasoning quality, increased repetition patterns, and degraded performance on edge cases. Most teams don't notice until it's already affecting user experience.\n\nSuccessful companies are building direct relationships with content creators, educational institutions, and professional communities to secure clean training data. Some are also investing heavily in synthetic data generation techniques that don't rely on existing AI outputs.\n\nThis isn't just a technical problem. It's becoming a business strategy issue where data sourcing affects competitive positioning. The companies that solve this early will have significant advantages as the internet becomes more AI-saturated.\n\nAre you seeing specific quality issues in your own models?"

    "selftext": "I've been heads down building an interactive audio platform for a few months now - basically podcasts where listeners can interrupt and ask questions to AI personas that creators design. The tech is working, I'm pumped about the vision, but I keep hitting a wall with one crucial thing: explaining it to regular people. Really need some advice from founders who've been here.\n\nEvery Sunday when I call home, my mom asks how my project is going, and I still haven't figured out how to explain it properly.\n\n\"It's like podcasts but you can talk to them.\"\n\n\"Talk to who?\"\n\n\"The AI voice that's reading the content.\"\n\n\"So it's not a real person?\"\n\n\"The content is created by real people, they just use AI voices to deliver it and respond to questions.\"\n\nShe pauses. \"I don't get it.\"\n\nThe frustrating part is, I KNOW this solves a real problem. Last week I was listening to a history podcast about the Roman Empire and had a dozen questions. Instead of pausing to ChatGPT or just wondering forever, imagine just asking and getting an answer from the host's AI persona, then continuing with the story. It's seamless, it's natural, it's how curiosity actually works.\n\nThe tech side is solid. I've built it, tested it, it works beautifully. Creators can define personalities, write content, and their AI voices can handle any question while staying in character. The demos blow people away... when they're tech people.\n\nBut my mom listens to podcasts for hours every day. She's literally who I'm building this for. And when I try to explain it, I watch her eyes glaze over somewhere between \"AI-powered\" and \"real-time interaction.\"\n\nShe asks reasonable questions: \"Why not just use their real voice?\" or \"What's wrong with regular podcasts?\"\n\nI have good answers - scalability, personalization, the ability to go deep on exactly what interests YOU. But I can't seem to translate these benefits into something that clicks for her.\n\nThe other day she said something that stuck with me: \"It sounds complicated.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the real problem. Not the idea, but how I'm presenting it. Because in my head, it's simple: podcasts you can talk to. But somehow, in trying to explain the how, I'm losing the why.\n\nI see the future so clearly - millions of people having actual conversations with their favorite content, getting their specific questions answered, feeling like they're part of the story instead of just passive listeners. But I can't seem to paint that picture for the one person whose opinion matters most to me.\n\nAnyone else struggled with this? When you're building something genuinely new, how do you find the words that make people see what you see? Because every Sunday that confused smile reminds me I haven't cracked the most important code yet - making people understand why this matters.",

But explaining it to her might go over her head because it's beyond her received information at this point in time. \n\nBut I do have a question, will this be implemented for the listener or will it be an option for each podcaster to have available?

Your mom would be a consumer of the tool, sure, but my assumption is you'd be selling it to the podcast creators to add as a tool to their podcasts, right? In that scenario, your mom and other podcast listeners likely won't even know you exsit, just a little bot in the corner that says \"Ask my a question about what you're hearing\" or little chat icon pops up that says \"Lots of more in depth information she available here, ask me a question to learn more\" in the context of the audio.\n\nElevator pitches are important. You should be able to distill your product into a 15-30 second pitch that makes sense. But not everything can be distilled into 5 words.\n\nOne fun thing might be tailoring your tagline to the genre of podcasts.

      "I really like the idea, and I can absolutely see the value of it. When it comes to explaining it to others, however, I'd suggest couching it in \\*their\\* language, not yours.\n\nThe moment you start using phrases like \"AI-powered\" and \"real-time interaction\", you're going to lose someone who's not already immersed in those sorts of areas. Think instead about framing the value in terms of what the end result will be to them, rather than how it's done - the truth is, nobody except tech people actually cares how any of this stuff really works. As an example:\n\n\"Imagine having your own personal news reader. They'll read to you all of your favourite news sources, magazines, podcasts etc., and you can even interrupt them to ask questions, and they'll answer as though they're there with you. Think of it like when you listen to your podcasts, but any time you don't understand something or have a question, the podcast host pauses what they're saying and explains it to you personally\"\n\nAnd, like others have said here, sometimes what's really needed to make it click is a good demo. Having a customer base that doesn't (yet) understand the value of your product doesn't mean the product is bad (think Henry Ford's famous quote about people wanting a faster horse), but it does mean you need to communicate to them in their own terms, not yours.\n\nGood luck!",

You're adding a new step that your mom doesn't need.  Most podcast listeners aren't treating this as a lesson that they need to understand--it's entertainment.

All I can see is a large number of users will perceive it as a bait-and-switch if all you're doing is speech to text on the podcast and the user's question and then providing an AI generated response that's \"in character\". Techies will inherently understand what this is and where its limits will be and use it in a way appropriate to its capabilities, but normies will eventually come to realize those limitations in the context of \"being ripped off\"... I am sure you can stem the tide on that with a very careful approach to marketing, but it feels like a can of worms to me.\n\ni guess there is some nuance to it. I would imagine that the nearby context of the question/answer interaction is highly relevant. e.g. i'd want to be able to blurt out stuff like \"can you explain what that is?\" without having to, you know like you would need with chatgpt for example, provide like a whole paragraph to provide context on what i want explained further.\n\nIMO the big complicated heavy lift here is the \"talking to\" bit.

      "There is a separate issue here about whether the idea is viable but if you're unable to explain it to your mother then yes, that is a red flag of your ability to pitch it. I don't even really understand it. So if I'm a host using this platform what happens? I log in, \"define my personality\" (whatever that means), and write content that is then read word for word by AI? And if someone interrupts then it will just generate a response on the fly using my voice and my pre-defined \"personality\"? Am I getting this?\n\nI think you should probably drop the idea of defining personalities and even the idea that the creator is writing instead of speaking, at least for the purpose of pitching it. Just say it's a podcast creation platform that lets creators make podcasts easier. Then the special sauce, the differentiator, and the second part of your pitch is the idea that listeners can interrupt the podcast and then an AI version of the host will interject answers to questions before resuming the pre-recorded podcast. It doesn't really matter if it will work differently with the host having to define a personality and write out content. All that matters, at least when pitching to your mom and other non-technical people, is that they understand the general problem that you're getting at and solving. Try something like:\n\n> Have you ever been listening to a podcast and had to pause it to go look something up that you didn't understand? Well wouldn't it be cool if you could just ask your question out loud and the host answered your specific question and then resumed? That sounds like magic but it's actually possible now using AI. I'm building a podcast creation platform that allows hosts to create shows just like they always have but my platform has AI technology that will generate answers to questions that you ask using the host's voice before preceding with the pre-recorded podcast. The host doesn't have to do any extra work, my technology uses AI to mimic their voice and personality, answer the question, and then resume the podcast where it left off.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure if there are worthwhile advantages to the idea that I think you described. Why not just have regular podcasts and then have a non-host assistant listening for questions, pausing the podcast when it hears one, and then interjecting the answers before resuming the podcast? Doing that would allow you to make this idea work with any podcast rather than having to build a whole platform from scratch and convince creators to join. You could even still clone the host's voice if you wanted by sampling it from the podcast (and getting consent probably) but I think that is an interesting bonus feature to explore and not part of the MVP. Honestly, I think it's better if the AI has a different voice so it's easy to tell when it's AI vs when the host is actually talking.\n\nMy two cents is that you should just make a podcast player that leverages the fact that Siri sucks. Right now it's clunky to ask questions, whereas the AI-enabled podcast player that I've just described would be a seamless experience that \"just works\" any time the listener asks questions. No need to fumble with Siri, plus your player would have the full podcast to use as context in order to answer the question accurately. I feel like what I'm describing would be more effective and easier to implement than what you described in your post. Another non-MVP feature could be using the same technology to identify and skip ads or just sections that the user is uninterested in. Honestly, I'm loving the idea of an AI-enabled podcast player where I can ask questions and skip ads. Lots of potential there. Please build that.",

      "You\u2019ve fallen in love with a solution before validating the market problem. Simple as. This is a trap because if you are passionate about the solution (which you clearly are) two things will happen: \n\n1. You will seek out and filter feedback for validation (subconsciously), and \n\n2. You will find ways to dismiss negative feedback (she\u2019s older, she doesn\u2019t get AI, she\u2019s a lagger, etc\u2026). \n\nYou have already built out the solution which is further entrenching yourself in a trap because now you have sunk cost and your pride is on the line. \n\nMy advice is this: \n\n1. Take an immediate step back and re-evaluate the problem you are trying to solve. Your challenge is that you are already biased towards a solution. So this will be painful. \n\n2. Think hard and write down every single assumption underlaying your belief about the problem you are trying to solve. And there\u2019s a lot. \u201cPeople want to interject and ask questions during a podcast\u201d, \u201cpeople believe that an AI can answer questions the same way the actual host can\u201d. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to google while listening to podcasts\u201d people want to speak out loud while riding the subway\u201d etc\u2026 \n\n3. Write down a test plan to validate EVERY assumption underlaying your market problem hypothesis. And execute on it. Ask \u201cwhat needs to be true for this assumption to be valid?\u201d And run test objectively as possible.\n\n4. Validate willingness to pay. This is critical. If the problem is real, then ask how people are solving it today, and what is the cost in time/money/software to accomplish it, etc.. \n\n5. Only once you\u2019ve validated the market problem and verified that it is a problem people will pay to solve, only THEN start exploring possible solutions. Explore widely and don\u2019t fall in love with any solutions. I would go as far as to gather solution ideas externally as much as possible to avoid this trap. \n\n6. Isolate a few promising solutions and prototype the shit out of them. Use AI prototyping tools to bang out many quick prototypes and get them in the hands of your market. Your goal is to ELIMINATE not validate possible solutions fast. Repeat until to narrow down to a single solution. Cultivate contempt for all your solutions until the research forced you to like one. I am 100% serious.\n\nNote: Get a handful of people who are willing to pay you UP FRONT for the solution. Offer them an early adopter discount or benefits but get money in hand. NOTHING validates a solution better than this. \n\n7. Get a production version in market as fast as possible by isolating the key features in your research. And be brutal. If it\u2019s not critical to solving the problem, postpone it. Real world validation is critical. \n\n8. Profit! Kidding. Even if you do all this, all you\u2019ve done is reduce probability of failure from about 98% to about 60%. \n\nThis sounds like a lot, but I guarantee that this process will take far less time than perusing a solution you believe with your full chest is a winner.

      "Hi! I'm a product designer and strategist with 15+ years of experience in tech, especially with early-stage start ups, and want to share my 2c on this. I hope this doesn't come off overly critical or bitchy, it's just something I've encountered a lot over the course of my career:  \n  \n2 things come up for me when I read this:\n\n1. Don't mention AI prominently unless you're talking to an audience that's all about it. Most people get confused and overwhelmed when you explain how something works technically. They don't need that info. Just explain the benefit to them (and not just a step by step of what they can do, but the benefit to them of doing it - either what is gained or what pain point are avoided). \n\n2. Did you do market or user research for this? Just because your mom listens to podcasts doesn't mean she wants to interrupt the hosts to ask questions, and doesn't mean she's your audience. Just because YOU want this, doesn't mean you have a market for it. \n\nYou're starting with a solid pain point: people listening to a podcast might have questions in the moment preventing them from understanding the material and distracting them from the podcast. \n\nOk, but \\*is\\* that a pain point? Have you done user research into the experience of podcast listeners? Do they struggle with this? What do they do when they encounter this situation? What's painful about that? My favorite shortcut user interview question: if you had a magic wand that would make this process perfect, what would that look like? \n\nHave you done usability testing with others using this product and reacting to it? When I think of myself using this product, I immediately think - I would have trouble interrupting a person who was talking. I know this is AI but we're human beings who are hardwired to anthropomorphize AI because they're way too human for our brains to feel comfortable with the difference. It would be rude to interrupt anyone that's speaking, but actually unthinkable to interrupt a podcast host. I don't know if people would actually feel that way using your product, that's why user testing and research is important.\n\nI see founders make this mistake 24/7/365. There's nothing wrong with building products for yourself and it's so cool that vibe coding allows for that now. But don't mix up \"i want this\" with \"the world wants this.\"  If you have a pragmatic cofounder and/or team that will allow you to remain as a visionary while they figure out what this thing should actually be and how to make it happen, that could work as it's a pretty tried and true approach. But I really hope you take this to heart: the code you haven't cracked yet isn't MAKING people understand why this matters, it's YOU understanding what matters to people within the confines of this product space. \n\nI wish you the best of luck with this. If anything I wrote resonates or sounds valuable, I'm always open to chatting.",
      "I think your mom's confusion isn't a red flag it's valuable market research. If you can't explain it simply to someone who loves podcasts you have a messaging problem not a product problem",
      "I like the project. Explain it to your mom: Imagine this: you are casually listening in to you two neighbours gossiping, you hear everything but you don't some missing details to fully understand what happened, you ofcourse cannot interrupt them in order to ask some questions to explain the situation because they are not even aware you are listening. Now imagine you have a magic possibilty to stop the time, ask the questions, get the answers you need and then let them return to the conversation forgetting you were there. Now you know that the reason for it all was Theresa's cheating husband who had two side pieces from work.",
      "As an avid podcast listener who also hosts my own podcast, I get your pitch! But I also see it running into a few possible numbers issues:\n\n1. Number of shows contributing: most shows contain at least *some* casual conversation or unscripted back and forth. All shows have unique catchphrases and personalities, which won\u2019t be easily captured and recycled by LLMs. Or if they do, it may sound clunky and obvious. Most creators see this as what makes their content unique and interesting (rightly or wrongly) and do **not** want AI to read their show completely. \n\n2. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re on top of this, but an alternative to this is to have hosts produce their show as normal, then only use AI voice for question responses. As both a creator and a consumer, I would feel slightly less bad about this. Still not crazy about my voice being used to say stuff I don\u2019t approve, but better than my voice recreated for a full episode. Another alternative could be to use a stock voice for these responses? \n\n3. Number of listeners: how many people want to listen to this? Of avid podcast listeners, how many want to ask questions? How many want to listen to AI voices?\n\n4. Network effects: will people need to upload their podcasts to your platform separately? Or will they be able to simply connect an existing RSS feed? Extra work for most shows is very unlikely to catch on. \n\n5. Needs to be very very very easy to bookmark and ask questions. Can you type questions, or do you need to speak them out loud? Consumers are very lazy (including myself), and if things aren\u2019t easy to use, they\u2019ll just go back to Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\n\nAs far as the pitch, I think you\u2019re onto something with \u201ca podcast you can talk to\u201d, and avoiding tech-heavy buzzwords.\n\nBest of luck, and please let me know if you have any questions or want me to elaborate on anything!",

Here\u2019s what we really care about:\u00a0\n\n1. The problem\n2. the solution\n3. traction\u00a0\n4. the ask\n\nExample:\n\n*Hey \\[Name\\], I\u2019m building \\[Startup Name\\], a platform helping \\[target audience\\] solve \\[specific problem\\] by \\[brief solution\\].

Would love to share more if this is relevant to your interests.*\n\n2-3 sentences max.\n\nWe get bombarded with hundreds of emails a day so what would make you instantly stand out is respecting our time and getting to the point.\n\nAlso please, no \"let me pick your brain\" or \"let's grab a cup of coffee\". You need to court before you date.\n\nThe worst DM's I get are\n\n* \"hey\"\n* \"can I pick your brain?\"\n* *\u201cHi Sir, I am building an app and wanted to check if you are open to investing.\u201d*\n\nFAQ\u2019s\n\n**Should I attach a deck or pitch link in the first message?**\n\nNo. Keep it conversational. Only share materials if they ask or express interest. Think of the first message as a hook, not a pitch.\n\n**How do I know if an investor is the right fit before messaging?**\n\nLook at their recent investments, Twitter/LinkedIn posts, or Crunchbase profile. Tailor your message to align with what they\u2019ve backed or talked about.\n\n**What if I don\u2019t have traction yet?**\n\nBe honest, but highlight momentum:\n\n*We launched last week and already have 200 signups with 10% conversion. Still early, but seeing strong signal.*\n\n**What\u2019s the biggest mistake founders make when reaching out?**\n\nWriting long, unfocused messages with no clear ask. Investors are scanning.

The correct answer to questions like \u201cshould I include a pitch deck?\u201d or \u201cshould I link to a video demo?\u201d are all just TEST. Use a tool like Mailshake to send 20 emails a day and look at your:\n\n\n\n1. Open rates. It they\u2019re below 60%, you either have email deliverability issues on your account/domain or your subject line sucks.

Use ContactOut or Clay or some other reliable finder.\n\n\n3. Reply rates. If your reply rates are sub-5%, your audience is not right (they invest in different areas etc) or your email sucks.\n\n4. Meeting rates. If you\u2019re not getting a meeting done with 1 in 3 of the positive replies, you\u2019re not setting it up right. Do NOT send a Calendly link - it\u2019s considered disrespectful for some reason and investors are less likely to take action. Instead, find THEIR time zone (look at their LinkedIn) and say:\n\n\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re in [timezone] - I\u2019m in [timezone] so the best crossover time looks like [time 1] or [time 2]. Are you available then on either:\n\n- [day, date 1] or\n- [day, date 2]?\u201d\n\n\nThey\u2019ll reply with a time and date.

A few sentences of story, a few bullet points calling out the highlights, a link to a deck - never an attachment! - and a clear ask. The subject line is critical. Not only is it the initial attention-getter, but it demonstrates to investors that you understand the art of getting a user's attention.\n\nAs far as selecting prospective investors, it's just like any other product / market fit exercise.

However, one of the things that was expressed to us during the startup accelerator we attended was, \"Are you constantly doing customer discovery?\" Congrats on the launched product.

      "The good news is that positive early response actually means you're onto something - most founders don't even get that far.\n\nHere's what I'd focus on with minimal cash:\n\n1. Double down on those early users who gave positive feedback. Talk to them directly - not surveys, actual conversations. Find out what specific problem you solved for them and why they care. This clarity becomes your messaging for finding similar users.\n\n2. Build in public. Share your journey, learnings, even struggles on platforms where your target users hang out. People connect with authentic stories more than polished marketing.\n\n3. Find one channel that works and go deep instead of spreading thin across multiple channels. Could be Reddit communities, LinkedIn, Twitter, or even offline meetups - whatever matches where your users actually spend time.\n\n4. Consider a waitlist or beta program if you haven't already. Creates urgency and helps you control growth while you're still figuring things out.\n\nThe key is being really specific about who you're building for. Generic messaging to \"everyone\" usually reaches no one, especially when you dont have budget for broad campaigns.\n\nWhat kind of feedback are you getting from those early users?

      "Ran this question by our CEO today and here's exactly what he said: \n\n\"The key thing here is you've already got active users, so talk to them. Continually talk to them. See how they're using your product and then iterate off that, because that will tell you what people are looking for and how people are actually using your product.\n\nThe worst thing you can do is build things that the market doesn't want, right? So talk to those current customers, understand what makes your product sticky with them and how can you increase that stickiness. Then take those talking points to the market.\n\nYou might be building features for what you think your ICP wants, when in actual fact, your early success is based around this one particular attribute that you didn't even know about.\n\nFor example, I worked with a company called 5CRM, which is an outbound style CRM platform for telemarketing companies. That's very much where their core was. But when we were working on bringing it to the US market, we saw a couple of clients come across from the addiction recovery industry.\n\nAnd we sort of dug a little bit deeper and realized that the same platform that was really suitable for telemarketing, managing bulk outbound contacts, had now become really useful for these addiction recovery centers. As a result, we sort of leant into that and spun off the product into what's now called Bee Purple, specifically designed for the addiction recovery industry.\n\nWe picked up a signal early and said, hey, we think there's a developing use case over here that we weren't necessarily marketing for, but they found a really strong usage of the product in their space. Unless you figure that out early and can see how those users are using it and talk to them about it, you'll probably lose that momentum, right? So dig into those client conversations, understand how clients are actually using the product and why. That's where you'll find your real opportunity to scale.\"\n\nI hope his answer was helpful! \n\n\\- Andrea @ Baremetrics"

    "title": "a short story about pain, pivots, and a founder falling out of love with his company (i will not promote)",
    "selftext": "Quick disclaimer and context:\u00a0**this is a short story that is 1000% fictional**, both the company and all the characters. I've worked at several startups and what's happening to a company and within a company has dominated the emotional landscape of my life while I'm there, but I find very little literary fiction written about work (or tech).\n\nMy goal was to capture the unique frustration of being so hamstrung by kind, reasonable people that you grow to resent them...\n\ni will not promote\n\n**THE PIVOT**\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s fire everyone,\u201d says Sam.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d says Davis. \u201cUm. Well, that\u2019s certainly one way to do things.\u201d It\u2019s 9:30 AM. He\u2019s had two espressos today already.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. We have to face facts. We need a hard reset. A clean slate.\u201d\n\nDavis paces the conference room restlessly. The glass is frosted up to 6 feet, which means all his employees know when their CEO is having a tough meeting because they see the top of his hair bobbing back and forth, like a worried, sentient toupee.\n\n\u201cLook, I appreciate the radical runway extension. But even if we were down to a skeleton crew of, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Davis sighs, mentally counting personnel, and mentally assigning himself the work of three normal engineers. \u201cFive people, say, to keep the product running. We\u2019re not going to grow our way out of this if we have no one to sell, or build, or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot sell this shit, Davis.\u201d Sam drops his voice, to sound more serious. Sam is Davis\u2019 chief-of-staff. He is only 22, and he still sounds 22. He is also 6\u20193\u201d, super handsome, a New Englander from his blonde hair down to his boat shoes. He alternates between weeks of consuming nothing but protein bars and energy drinks and Eastern European snuff films, and weeks of monastic purity, eating handfuls of nuts and taking punishing cold showers. His appearance speaks of well-groomed power. But he doesn\u2019t have any power, of course. Davis has power. Sam has always approached Davis with a reverent, intensely earnest posture, and Davis would be lying if he said this didn\u2019t bring him some real gratification.\n\nSo this harsh statement, coming from Sam, is enough to stop Davis in his tracks. \u201cTom\u2019s numbers are still good,\u201d he says woodenly.\n\n\u201cTom. Is not replicable. And Tom will back me up on this. Honestly, Davis, he\u2019s interviewing at Square.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Davis sits down very heavily. This is a serious loss. Tom is the VP of Zuby\u2019s small sales team, and also their top salesperson, and the only person who has been able to sell manufacturers on Zuby in any serious quantity. \u201cFuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, man, you know I admire the fuck out of you,\u201d Sam says, all sweetness again. \u201cAnd I think the worst case scenario for you, and for me! Like, being honest here. Is that Q3 numbers are just good enough to keep going, and then Q4 is good, because Q4, and organic gingerbread or whatever, and then we raise a fucking terrible Series C, like a down round or something, and then you and me are stuck doing something that is fundamentally doomed for another 2 years. And then we shut down. Like, psychic damage, you know?\u201d\n\nDavis is resisting the urge to slam his head into the conference room table. He ponders if his skull could break it. The table is glass, covered in a rainbow holographic treatment, and left over from the office\u2019s previous tenants, a failed anime porn company. He bought it from them in the spirit of thrift for $150.\n\n\u201cLook, I have something to pitch you.\u201d\n\nDavis doesn\u2019t respond right away. He is retracing his steps, from the first spark of inspiration to the first customer interviews to the first pitch, looking for a flaw in his work, trying to figure out what small or large mechanism he can tinker with to make this thing work. This is what is most lovable about Davis\u2014 his megawatt attention, shackled firmly to his stubborn, irrational heart.\n\n\u201cOkay, go,\u201d Davis says finally, with a sigh.\n\nHad any other Zuby employee been in the room to hear his pitch, they\u2019d probably throw Sam\u2019s purple bottle of Future Freeze Prime at his head.\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\nDavis Budny is Zuby\u2019s founder and CEO. He is 28, and all that everyone feels a young man should be. He is possessed of two funding rounds, technical skills both broad and current, vision and verve, an attractively furnished apartment, thick brown hair, and a three-legged rescue cat. Until 26 he sported slightly below average looks compensated for by his reedy, 6\u20192\u201d height, but two years ago he discovered he could grow very flattering facial hair, and much was remedied by this.\n\nDavis likes to make people happy. His mother is a history professor; his father was a software engineer. Davis\u2019 teachers often said he was \u201craised right.\u201d By this, they likely meant that despite being remarkably, remarkably smart, Davis never seemed lazy nor arrogant. This is because Davis is neither lazy nor arrogant. On the contrary, Davis is born of Polish peasant stock on both sides and has all the work ethic of his ancestors, and a great willingness to think himself ordinary.\n\nHe did suspect at a young age that he might have a special sort of brain. He often pictured his own brain as a plodding draft horse, head down, muscles straining. Cleverer students would listen to lectures at 2x; Davis was pausing so often he basically listened at .5x. But after a certain amount of heavy pondering, he would find that he had internalized the lesson so deeply that he could suddenly slingshot far ahead, rushing past the current state of the field. Later, a VC would tell him that he really thought \u201cfrom first principles,\u201d a compliment Davis earnestly cherished until he realized the investor told everybody that.\n\nZuby is Davis\u2019 second company. He doesn\u2019t like to talk about the first, because of the dogs, which were truly not his fault! And likely already aggressive and badly trained. Unfortunately the dogs made him a bit of a Silicon Valley punchline for a few years, which caused his natural brilliance to go under-recognized. Luckily, with his usual inherent wisdom, Davis humbly retreated to a quiet enterprise software company hidden in the waystation of San Jose, and their eventual IPO gave him both $2.7m in long-term capital gains and enough courage to try again.\n\nThere are 38 employees at Zuby (54 if you count contractors, which the team normally does not). 9 of these employees like Davis, 23 feel neutrally, and 6 employees think he is a moron and/or jerk. A 16% malcontent rate is actually very good for a series B company. Too good, some of the investors say. \u201cSoft on people,\u201d they say.\n\nIt\u2019s true that despite being blessed with above average salaries, a top-tier health insurance plan, and a generous CEO who carries the gentle air of apology that all software engineers educated at liberal arts colleges share, the employees of Zuby are garrulous, dissatisfied, and prone to spending hours agitating each other to mutiny in secretive Slack channels with names like Thursday-committee and Zuby-cozy-gamers. Half the company thinks the company is going under. Half the company thinks capitalism should be replaced. Most of the company thinks Davis could be doing a better job and no grouping more permanent than 2 individuals on a coffee date for 30 min can agree on what he should be doing differently.\n\nAmong those of the 38 who will bother to reminisce on this brief, clumsy brio of human ambition coalesced into a b2b commerce platform, this particular day, August 5th, will stand in infamy. Pivot Day, they\u2019ll call it, or, the day Davis lost his fucking mind.\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\n\u201cHas he lost his fucking mind,\u201d Rishi intones. \u201cYou have to be kidding me. A digital grocery store?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not kidding,\u201d Samantha hisses, trying to keep her voice down. \u201cYou have to help me talk him out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, fuck him,\u201d Rishi exclaims. \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste my time talking him out of it. Goddamnit, I have to start applying for jobs. Tom has the right idea here. We gotta get out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoo\u2026no, no, no, no, no,\u201d Samantha pleads. \u201cRishi, I\u2019m only telling you this because he trusts you. So much! Like, he respects you so, so much! And I honestly think this plan is just a good wake-up call that we need to rethink the core business.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, yeah, if by rethink you mean evacuate yesterday.\u201d Rishi has turned his chair away from Samantha and back to his second screen. He\u2019s on LinkedIn already. He grimaces, unhappy with what he sees. Rishi Balakrishnan is on the older side for Zuby, a septuagenarian at 35. Davis wanted an older CTO, someone who had scaled a SaaS product before, but who wouldn\u2019t chafe under his habit of nervous micromanagement. Rishi is temperate and wise indeed, as you would be too if you had two sweet daughters and a hefty Redwood City mortgage riding on your job, but Zuby has never found enough customers to make Rishi\u2019s experience all that relevant.\n\nSamantha groans under her breath and adjusts the perfect waves in her black hair out of nervous habit. She is Zuby\u2019s COO, and until Sam\u2019s arrival 9 months ago, she was Davis\u2019 closest confidante and the biggest influence on his thinking. She is 30, and generally perceived by Zuby employees as one of the two \u201cadults\u201d in the room (Rishi being the other). The two have formed an alliance of reasonableness. They arrive early for the weekly C-suite leadership meetings and decide ahead of time which of the two will be the calm one and which of the two will entertain Davis\u2019 increasingly panicked ideas to Save The Company.\n\nSamantha Kim\u2019s resume is sterling, even better than Davis\u2019. She went to Yale, worked at Bain, went to the GSB, then worked at Facebook. In other words, she is a coward. She joined Zuby because of an alleged passion for small organic food businesses. It\u2019s true that while at Facebook, she made 750 granola bars and thought about starting a small organic food business. But ultimately she gave them away at a church bake sale and joined Zuby instead.\n\nDavis is not an idiot. His natural loyalty is to Samantha, who has been invaluable to Davis in a million small ways and a few critical big ones. He is also aware despite all the self-professed admiration, Sam shit-talks him often to friends from Twitter. Whereas Davis has the strong but unprovable impression that Samantha never could, even in the unknowable intimacy of Samantha\u2019s own home, with her husband who grilled Davis at last year\u2019s Christmas party and seemed profoundly unimpressed. Samantha is loyal, like Davis. But she is also scared, and increasingly Davis has no use for anyone who is scared.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to say to him at steering?\u201d Samantha asks Rishi dully.\n\n\u201cDoes he know you told me?\u201d Rishi asks.\n\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t really care either way, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll kick off the meeting by pitching us so...\u201d Samantha feels a perverse sort of excitement for this momentous upcoming meeting. She is by nature fearful of confrontation, but even she has been aching for relief after months of quiet tension in the office.\n\n\u201cThe Sams must have it out,\u201d Meghan, an ops associate, likes to joke. \u201cWinner keeps their job.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, loser has to stay here,\u201d her friend Ethan likes to add.\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\nOkay, let me tell you really quick what Zuby does. Zuby is a specialty food distributor masquerading as a tech company. The company aggregates cool organic/healthy/indie/up-and-coming food brands and tries to distribute them to stores, like coffee shops and shabby organic grocers from Ojai to Highland Park. The dream would be getting major grocery stores to sign up\u2014 Samantha has been personally hounding the buyers at Whole Foods, for instance.\n\nMerchants want cool snacks to sell. Cool snack companies want to be on shelves. Cool snack makers (hands full of organic granola) don\u2019t have the money or time for sales. Two-sided marketplace, aggregate the long tail, ride a macro trend, ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, $200m valuation. That\u2019s where the problem started.\n\nThe problem, they discovered, is that no one big will pay for it. The sales team, which by necessity has included Samantha, Sam and Davis himself, has met two types of customers. The first is an extended cousin of their own white-collar, PMC peer group. The college-educated real estate guy who opened a cool coffee shop, the ex-engineer who now makes protein biscuits. They get it, they love it, they sign up for Zuby, then they go out of business rapidly.\n\nOr, if they succeed and stay in the business, they slowly morph into customer type two: a grizzled food guy, a low-margin hustler, bags under their eyes and Zyn in their mouth, uninterested in discussing the future and more interested in discussing whether Zuby will offer a subsidized rate on refrigerated trucking (they will not). They don\u2019t want to pay, they\u2019re constantly trying to sneak business off the platform, they trudge up to the Zuby booth at trade shows and swill the free coffee with cynical, deadened eyes before asking about discounts. \u201cYou\u2019ll be out of business soon, right,\u201d they always ask, possibly because all they think about every morning is the dark siren call of the void (closing the business and taking a nap).\n\nThis is an energizing, fixable challenge for Samantha. This is vaguely concerning background noise to Rishi (who Davis and Samantha gently shield from these realities, as they feel a good CTO deserves). The stagnation is a daily, skull-bruising, brain-shattering pain for Davis.\n\nBut he still can\u2019t bring himself yet to really see Zuby as it is. Behind every half-assed feature he sees the long and arduous compromise to make it exist; every problem speaks only of its possible solutions. But the truth is that Sam the carpetbagger is right. Zuby is hopelessly overvalued. Zuby is going nowhere. Zuby is a wounded, bewildered beast, overfed and huge-bellied, mournful and whipped on all sides to move with speed of which it is no longer capable, to a destination no one can identify. Keen observers regard it with distaste and compassion. Secretly its two largest investors agree it needs to be put down.\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\n\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re doing in there,\u201d Ethan asks Meghan. He twitches a pen nervously between his fingers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be so emotionally invested in their meetings,\u201d Meghan says primly. She is generating an internal report on merchant churn. She and Ethan sit across from each other habitually, and have spent almost a thousand hours in conversation with each other, but only forty-two of those hours have involved direct eye contact. They prefer to keep two laptop screens, twenty-five inches of white desk, and a task and a half between themselves. In one sense, they are best friends. There is no one the other has spoken to more in the past two years. In another sense, neither knows the other\u2019s middle name.\n\n\u201cI think Sam is going to join,\u201d Ethan forecasts dourly, as he does every week. Sam\u2019s inclusion in the occasional steering meeting is a real thorn in Ethan\u2019s side. Ethan is a young, high energy engineer who does half of Rishi\u2019s work and most of everyone else\u2019s. Ethan is also burdened with the CTO\u2019s private, end-of-week grumblings. After Meghan\u2019s own downloads from Samantha, Ethan and Meghan like to go for a beer and piece together the complaints into a increasingly dire picture of their employer\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cYou cannot honestly be jealous that he takes notes in meetings,\u201d Meghan says. She is a natural peace-keeper, a real Libra. Her great talent is that she can peaceably digest literally anything the execs want to say\u2014dire pronouncements, declarations of defeat, 2AM podcast links\u2014 with placid gentleness and produce eight hours later some internal memo or deck that soothes their inflamed hearts. Ethan attributes this preternatural calm to Meghan\u2019s one great hobby, running marathons. He imagines that she just sweats out all the resentment and pinprick-sharp anxiety that animates him all day. Ethan does not run marathons, he does not even rock climb or urban bike. He has no time, as he is always working.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an assistant,\u201d Ethan grumbles. \u201cA glorified assistant that for some reason thinks he\u2019s better than me. I swear to god if he has 1%\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god, Ethan,\u201d Meghan sighs. \u201cI am not checking Carta for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s gay,\u201d Ethan continues conspiratorially. \u201cWhich is fine!\u201d He hurriedly clarifies, as Meghan finally looks up from her laptop with admonishments ready. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously fine! But it\u2019s hypocritical, with his politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I actually heard from Lucy that her roommate went to Dartmouth with him. And\u2014\u201d\n\nWhat gossip or defense Meghan could provide was lost to time. At that very moment Sam pushes back from his standing desk (\u201dSitting is bad for testosterone levels,\u201d he says) and enters the steering meeting.\n\nEthan lets out a muffled yelp of indignation and gets nothing else done that afternoon. He\u2019ll have to stay late instead.\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\nIt\u2019s 3PM. Inside the conference room, Sam sits on one side of the table, with Rishi and Samantha on the other. As if it\u2019s an arbitration, Davis sits at the head of the table between them. He drinks a third espresso.\n\n\u201cWhat is a digital grocery store\u2026 Like, Instacart?\u201d Samantha asks slowly.\n\nSam responds, \u201cNo, the food is digital!\u201d\n\nRishi chuckles.\n\nSam continues, \u201cSo users scan the code on the box. It gives them, like, say, 3 FoodCoin, right? More expensive food, or promotions\u2026 we can adjust on the backend how many FoodCoin you get!\u201d\n\nSamantha\u2019s hands dig into the side of her laptop so hard that her fingertips turn white.\n\nRishi says, \u201cSo it\u2019s crypto Boxtops?\u201d\n\nSam leaps up while everyone else remains seated. \u201cYes! Dude, that\u2019s such a good line.\u201d\n\nSamantha speaks slowly, mentally patting the floor around her in search of the sanity that seems to have been dropped fifteen minutes ago. \u201cOk, look. Crypto is kind of controversial. Some VC\u2019s still like it, but\u2014\u201d\n\nRishi\u2019s curiosity is irrepressible. Also, at this point, he has already decided to find a new job. \u201cWhat is the FoodCoin for?\u201d\n\nSam paces the room like Davis does. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part. So you take the FoodCoin and bring it to ZubyMart. And you get digital food.\u201d This phrase seems to break something in Samantha, who turns her laptop on its side and starts chewing her knuckles.\n\nRishi asks, \u201cBut what is the digital food for?\u201d\n\nSam shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like a collectible, or maybe we make a game?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we make a game?!\u201d Samantha thunders. Even Sam\u2019s eyes grow a little wider. No one at Zuby has seen her like this. Some long-buried gorge is rising in her throat and her eyes spark with new power. \u201cDavis, you cannot possibly be considering this. A pivot at this stage is crazy enough, but\u2026This! Is not even! A reasonable pivot!\u201d\n\nAll eyes turn towards Davis. He is seated at the head of the dead ex-tenant\u2019s rainbow conference table, his fingers tented and his gaze pointed at no one in the room. His out-of-character silence amidst the chaos gives him a new, ominous air. Who is this guy, Rishi and Samantha think.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to be building,\u201d Sam says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been building!\u201d Samantha shrieks. \u201cYou are not even\u2014Rishi, please!\u201d\n\nRishi shrugs.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Samantha says. \u201cDavis! Come on! This is not, like, responsible behavior.\u201d\n\nMore thoughtful silence.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything!\u201d\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\nHere\u2019s what happened with Davis\u2019 first company. In college, Davis studied electrical engineering and computer science. Studying both is actually pretty rarefied. You might think you know a lot of \u201csoftware engineers\u201d who can make a website, but you probably don\u2019t know many genuine\u00a0*computer scientists.*\u00a0Davis is the real fucking deal. He invented a protocol that uses sound waves to transmit data. It had been done a few times before, but Davis\u2019 method was the best. Longest distances, worked on really, really old devices, and he packaged it up into the most beautiful, foolproof dev kit. He wanted to use it in disaster zones, Third World countries, places with no wi-fi or phone service. He thought maybe he could be a missionary like his great-grandfather, but with connectivity.\n\nHis professor convinced him to explore point-of-sale instead\u2014paying phone-to-phone. He dropped out. They raised a seed round. Professor was chairman of the board, Davis was the CEO and the face. Of course this made it easy for the professor to throw Davis under the bus when things went south.\n\nLong story short, apparently the sounds, although inaudible to human ears, drove dogs insane. There were nine bite incidents and three dogs got put down. One bit a kid at Coupa Cafe. Honestly, how could Davis have known? Of course there weren\u2019t dogs roaming around EE lab during testing. The problem was even fixable, but the PR was not. When Davis was first introduced to Sam, Sam told Davis he thought Wavely had been treated totally unfairly, and three very large beers later Davis was sorrowfully agreeing. \u201cI could have fixed it! I just needed like two months.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sam had hissed. \u201cImagine holding up human progress over a dog.\u201d These were suspicious dogs, after all! Smooth-headed, big-skulled pitbulls, bred in backyards and relinquished over and over until they found a home with some soft-hearted oat-milk drinker who blamed Davis for what was probably inevitable!\n\nAnd ever since, Davis has been trying to win back the industry\u2019s love, been trying to redeem himself. He shouldn\u2019t need to. What have all these hecklers ever built? That\u2019s what Sam said, anyway.\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\n\u201cUh, so, should I start architecting this? What protocol do you want to use?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo all the brands have the same Coin or is it like, one coin per brand?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes this mean I can stop fixing tickets?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to be fired?\u201d\n\nSuch were the unenlightened questions that mid-level and senior-level employees had as Samantha called them into the room one-by-one, like a late afternoon death march, throwing bodies desperately as random bullet spray in an attempt to win her case. Her fingers are flying across her keyboard as she messages people, arms them with talking points and supportive emojis before they come in.\n\nSamantha\u2019s plan is this. First off, she knows Davis is not that good at firing people. She figures if she makes him look everyone in the eye\u2014especially the mid-level managers he most trusts\u2014there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to go through with this insane crypto pivot bullshit.\n\nSecondly, she\u2019s counting on every person who\u2019s consulted to agree that, in fact, the idea is bullshit. A Zuby employee is a very timid creature, actually. They are afraid of getting yelled at. They don\u2019t want anything to be \u201ctheir fault\u201d. They like consensus. They like actionable plans. They love a puzzle with a 7 out of 10 difficulty. Zuby has steadily provided a stream of 7/10 difficulty puzzles\u2014how to scrape together a list of the fastest growing CPG brands in California, how to make nice UI if every single food category has different tags and specifications, how to de-conflict inventory data across multiple warehouses. The collective deal Zuby employees have made with Davis is that he gets to point them at any 7/10 difficulty puzzle in the world, and they\u2019ll solve it. Just watch them. They\u2019re lean, whip-smart intellectual thoroughbreds ready to run. But in exchange, Davis must promise that great riches are contingent on this specific set of 7/10 puzzles. Obviously Davis has broken the deal. Zuby has not. This is how Samantha sees things.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s chaos outside that conference room. Tom, one of the first to be called in, is a medium-level gossiper but a very good boss, and after grimly delivering his verdict\u2014\u201dYeah, this isn\u2019t working\u201d\u2014he gathers his lieutenants around him to share the dire news of a looming pivot. They sit on the giant carpeted blocks of the building\u2019s lobby, grim-faced as GIs staring at Normandy. \u201cHow many layoffs, you think?\u201d one salesman asks Tom. \u201cDeep cuts,\u201d Tom replies. \u201cI\u2019m gonna warn my friend.\u201d \u201cYou do you.\u201d\n\nBy 4:15PM, approximately 97% of Zuby\u2019s staff is aware that their CEO is contemplating a massive change in the business (1 employee is on maternity leave). No one is working. Clique-ish huddles have formed. One daring young employee is writing ideas on a whiteboard, in case Davis asks him what he thinks the company should do next. Beers are being passed around. A storm brews outside in the blue twilight, making the florescence of the office look even brighter, almost beautiful. It feels like the last day of school.\n\nMeghan steps outside to get some air. In her pocket, her phone buzzes non-stop. It\u2019s always a jarring transition, where the clean white marble of their building\u2019s lobby stops, and the urine-soaked concrete outside begins. A summer storm is coming, the air warm and sticky and disgusting. She leans against the building\u2019s red brick wall. It\u2019s 5PM, and slackers and South Bay commuters are beginning to trickle out of the offices around them. They\u2019re identified by shirts, fleeces, messenger bags, all bearing the name of their tribe. Megan ticks off names as they pass\u2014goodnight DataCat, goodnight Surmisely, goodnight Airpoint. They are unaware of one of their number laying inside on the operating table, chest open.\n\nMeghan tries to picture losing her job. For a moment it\u2019s as surreal as stepping into an alternate universe, and in the next moment it\u2019s utterly quotidien. What is she freaking out about? She can go to grad school. She can write that book. Take time off, travel. Her parents pay her rent. She goes back inside.\n\n\\~\\*\\~\n\nBy 7PM the office is mostly empty, and even Ethan has given up eavesdropping and waiting. Davis, Sam and Samantha, and Rishi (though he is mostly playing games on his phone at this point) remain holed up in the conference room. Empty cups and cans overflow from the unlined trash bin. A pizza sits untouched on the table.\n\n\u201cNo one thinks this is a good idea,\u201d Samantha is insisting.\n\n\u201cLook, this is ultimately on me, okay?\u201d Davis says, rubbing his temples. He hasn\u2019t had any food all day. \u201cIt\u2019s my neck on the line. I want to try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone works here,\u201d Samantha says acidly. \u201cNot just you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, but for them it\u2019s a job. For me\u2026I\u2019m the one who raised the money. I\u2014I don\u2019t mean this in an egotistical way, but we have to bet on my intuition here, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your intuition is we should make cheddar snacks into crypto bets?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, look, it\u2019s a seed. It\u2019s exciting! It\u2019s got\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say vibes right now, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d\n\nSam snorts. Samantha shoots him a glare.\n\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with vibes?\u201d Davis says. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we just follow vibes instead of\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of business plans, adult logic\u2026\u201d\n\nSam jumps in. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t be offended, Samantha, but I think\u2026\u201d He hesitates, or pretends to hesitate. \u201cI think consultant thinking is how we got here to begin with.\u201d\n\nAt this point Samantha, who is missing her niece\u2019s birthday dinner, grabs Sam\u2019s Prime and throws it against the wall. Rishi yelps in alarm as it passes him by.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ, calm down!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are so fucking disrespectful,\u201d Samantha yells, yelling for possibly the first time since she\u2019s been working at Zuby. \u201cWhat do you know about food?\u201d\n\n\u201cOr crypto,\u201d Rishi comments idly, thumbs twitching away. \u201cIt\u2019s gnarly in there right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to know about food,\u201d Sam shoots back. \u201cI know about the meta. And this is the move.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Davis says with great finality. \u201cIs what is happening.\u201d\n\n\\~\\*\\~",

      "man this hits way too close to home. the whole dynamic between Davis and Sam, the glass conference room where everyone can see your stressed out pacing... ive been there.\n\n\n\nwhat really got me was the part about falling out of love with your own company. i remember when i first started building businesses, there was this moment where i realized i was spending more time managing people's feelings and navigating office politics than actually solving the problems i set out to solve. its soul crushing.\n\n\n\nthe hardest part for me was when my ADHD would make me hyperfocus on fixing everything at once - fire everyone, pivot completely, start over. but then you realize that radical moves like that usually just create more chaos, not less.\n\n\n\nive found that sometimes the \"kind, reasonable people\" Davis resents aren't the real problem - its that the company culture never had clear execution systems in place from the start. when everyone's being nice but nothing's getting done, its usually because theres no accountability structure.\n\n\n\nanyway, really well written. captures that specific startup dread perfectly. the detail about seeing just the top of his hair through the frosted glass is chef's kiss\n\n\n\nalso props for the disclaimer about not promoting anything. we need more authentic storytelling in this space without people trying to sell us something every paragraph lol"

In the last 6 weeks, we\u2019ve onboarded 400+ users and received 900+ selfies on our simple prototype.\n\nDistribution is in motion, the waitlist is growing, designs are done, and we\u2019re halfway through development. Launch planned next month. For the next 25 days, I\u2019m going all-in on raising our pre-seed round, while my co-founder (CTO) continues driving product.\n\nWe\u2019ve spoken to folks in our network, some small soft commitments are in, but now we want to widen the circle: syndicates, solo LPs, micro-VCs, early-stage VCs, early-stage angels, or anyone who really gets consumer tech, or B2C2B loops in India or Outside. We're already incorporated as a Delaware C-corp.\n\nMy question to experienced founders here: If you were us, early traction, bold vision, no public presence yet, how would you raise smartly and fast? Cold DMs? Syndicates? Accelerators? Anything scrappy or strategic you\u2019ve seen work, I\u2019m all ears.\n\nAppreciate any advice, stories, or even leads. We\u2019re here to execute.

      "Warm intros and accelerators are great shouts.\n\nFor cold DMs, the messaging will need to be highly tailored and make sure you fit the investor's thesis. Otherwise, the likelihood of response is extremely low.\n\nTry to line up all your calls and meetings with investors for a 2 week period, such that you can build momentum and FOMO amongst the investors. Best case, you\u2019re going back to investors a week after your call with them saying the round\u2019s nearly full or you\u2019ve got X committed.",

      "Dude, I love the energy! Getting traction in just 6 weeks AND having clarity on your product and team roles? That's seriously impressive. And smart move on the Delaware C-Corp setup early - so many founders mess that up later.\n\nOkay, so you've already got some real signal here (users taking selfies = actual data you can work with), which puts you in a pretty good spot. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n**Go fast on validation with crowdfunding**\u00a0\\- I know this might sound weird for pre-seed, but hear me out. If your users are passionate about what you're building, why not consider testing a small equity crowdfunding campaign while you're raising funds? It's like killing three birds with one stone - you look more legit, you grow your audience, and suddenly all those angels sitting on the fence start paying attention because of FOMO.\n\n**Hit up the syndicates and solo investors**\u00a0\\- Check out stuff like AngelList India (if that works for you), Hustle Fund's Angel Squad, or Sahil Bloom's crew. Here's the thing about D2C + AI + skincare - it's all about the story and the feels. Make sure your pitch is the kind of thing people want to forward in their group chats or slide into DMs with.\n\n**Keep it scrappy with the outreach**\u00a0\\- Forget those massive pitch decks. Just make a solid 10-slider, hit up people who've backed similar stuff, and go straight to Twitter DMs or quick calls. Don't lead with \"give me money\" - ask for advice first, then close the smart ones fast. Oh, and accelerators like Lightspeed Extreme or Antler can also help amplify your signal.\n\nI've helped a bunch of founders navigate this stuff without giving up too much control or equity too early, especially in consumer tech. Shoot me a DM if you want - I've got a pretty tactical playbook that's worked well in similar situations. I will not promote.",
      "Raising funds efficiently involves several strategic steps. Firstly, leverage your current traction numbers as they show potential to investors. Besides cold DMs, consider joining an accelerator, which can offer mentorship and access to a strong network. Creating a concise yet impactful pitch deck is crucial. Highlight your unique selling proposition and potential market size. Networking at industry events or virtual meetings can open doors too. Additionally, keep your early adopters engaged and treat any feedback as valuable, using it to iterate your product effectively before full launch. Best wishes with your fundraising effort!",
      "Congratulations on reaching this exciting stage of your startup! Raising a pre-seed round can indeed be challenging, especially with limited public presence. Leveraging platforms that connect startups with investors, such as AngelList, might be a strategic step. Participating in startup accelerators can also provide not just funding, but invaluable mentoring and networking opportunities. Consider reaching out to other founders who've successfully raised funds for their insights. Cold DMs can work if they're personalized and clearly convey your unique value proposition. I wish you much success with your fundraising efforts!",
      "Congratulations on your progress with your AI-powered skincare platform. At this stage, leveraging incubators and accelerators could provide not just funds but also valuable mentorship and networking opportunities. Exploring platforms like AngelList can help you connect with early-stage investors who are interested in tech innovations. Additionally, storytelling in your pitches, highlighting your traction and vision, can be very compelling. Good luck with your pre-seed round!"

Most of the startups that I know are already ESG centered in their approach - alternative proteins, side stream upcycling, more efficient processes, sustainable packaging, etc. They all lead to a lower GHG footprint and other benefits. Although their business model is centered around that, I haven't seen any startups spending serious money on consulting or other ESG improvements. They have the goal to survive, which is already hard for some. I remember one mildly successful startup telling the story on how they had to compromise some of its ESG ambitions to make it more lucrative and to survive. They still kept their central piece ESG focused, but they had to give up on packaging sustainability or on some sourcing priorities. So I am telling you this to say that startups might not have the capital and the bandwidth to engage in ESG consulting. You may be able to do that for some mid range or bigger companies, but even their approach is quite business centered. Any improvement has to make business sense, otherwise, they won't do it. For example, some spin improvement in processes as GHG footprint reduction, but in the end it is about the Benjamins, or Euros, but the improvement has the added benefit of being sustainable.

    "selftext": "Hey fellow startups! I've been thinking a lot about the intersection of AI, privacy, and market demand. As we all know, data breaches are becoming more frequent, and yet, most AI solutions rely on cloud-based APIs that put user data at risk.\n\nI'm building an app that focuses on private AI development, prioritizing user data protection above performance. Sounds great in theory, but here's the catch: our LLMs might not be as capable as those offered by cloud-based solutions... yet.\n\nSo, I'd love to ask you guys: how do we market a product that has worse LLMs but better privacy controls? What's it going to take for users to demand private AI alternatives? How many high-profile data breaches will it take before consumers start voting with their wallets for apps that prioritize their data protection?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and perhaps together we can create a movement towards more private AI solutions.\n\ni will not promote",

    "selftext": "I am a frequent user of Google Drive, especially Google Sheets. I used the tool a lot in two companies, and I currently use it to do accounting for a restaurant. A few weeks ago, my partners (who are more on the operational side) started delegating simple tasks, like loading data into some spreadsheets, and that's when a problem arose:\n\nThe sheets are built with internal logic, the folders are organized in a way that is convenient for us, and a lot of data is taken from other Drive files. When we started delegating, we were forced to give access to folders that also contain sensitive information. That's when one of my partners asked me: **\u201cCan't you put a password on this?\u201d** And the answer was **no**.\n\nThat led me to wonder if this type of need (to have more control and security in Drive or Sheets) is something that only happens to a few, or if it could be a more general problem.\n\nWhat do you think? Has something similar happened to anyone else? I'm interested in understanding if this could make sense as a basis for thinking about a real solution.",

Generally, we restrict access to team members who need it. Obviously, sometimes other departments need access to certain folders/files. In that case, if I can I just limit access to single files. If more than that is necessary, I generally will either strip the sensitive data from a file or create a new file with only the necessary data. \n\nGranted, you CAN password protect a sheets file. You just need to have the drive extension on your computer and upload protected excel files through there. You won\u2019t be able to open them in your browser as a G sheet, but you can open them through the extension (and therefore excel) on your desktop.

They promote your stuff more intentionally like blog posts, email lists, content, whatever. For some of them, it\u2019s even a full-time income stream.\n* **Referring customers**\u00a0are usually just happy users who casually share your product with a friend. Less marketing savvy, but it works because it\u2019s\u00a0*real*. The reward is a nice bonus, but it\u2019s not the main motivation.\n\nFrom the business POV, which one should you choose?\n\n**When to use affiliate marketing:**\n\n1. You want to reach a broader audience: Affiliates often have an existing platform like blogs, YouTube, social media, etc. You\u2019re basically tapping into their audience and extending your reach without building it from scratch.\n2. You want to drive sales without big upfront costs: You only pay when they bring you results. No need for big paid ad campaigns cause it\u2019s performance-based.\n3. You want to scale without hiring: Instead of growing your in-house marketing team, affiliates can act as an external sales force promoting your product.\n\n**When to use referral marketing:**\n\n1. You want to build customer loyalty: Referral programs reward your current customers for spreading the word, which helps strengthen their connection with your brand.\n2. You want to tap into trust and credibility: People trust recommendations from friends and family more than ads. If you have happy users, let them do the talking.\n3. You want organic, word-of-mouth growth: Referrals are a great way to grow without spending a ton. They feel natural and authentic, which makes them super effective.\n\n*TL;DR:*\u00a0if you want quick, organic growth from your existing customers, go referral.

It lets separated parents log incidents, store docs, and export a clean timeline when things get messy.\n\nNow it\u2019s out in the wild, and a few people I know are using it, but I\u2019m looking for smart, ethical ways to get traction without being spammy or exploiting a sensitive topic.\n\n**If you\u2019ve launched something in a legal, mental health, or \u201cserious life problem\u201d space, how did you get early traction?**  \nDid you work with professionals?

I\u2019m building in healthcare which fits the bill of \u2018serious life problems\u2019.\n\nThe key is to get buy in from BOTH the professionals involved and users. For example, if I\u2019m building a patient-facing product, getting input from health professionals is essential. They give you important perspective, and more importantly, they will be indirectly interacting with your product. So you want them to at the very least not hate it (even if they\u2019re not the user). \n\nAs for finding your users, forums are great. Reddit is great. Facebook is great. It\u2019s like any other start-up, go to where your users are hanging out.\n\nYou absolutely don\u2019t need paid ads. Spend hours learning directly from users, and they\u2019ll be invested in the product before you even have an MVP to show.",

Think chrome, vaporware, neon grids, Miami vice, retro game boy, futiger aero, etc. \n\nThe product I\u2019m developing encapsulates this feeling, this yearning for the future of the past. And not in a gimmicky way, but in a way that feels almost like a lifeline. I was born in 03 so I clearly remember my mom switching from a flip phone to a blackberry to an iPhone and the days when tech felt exciting all the time and it felt like the future was going to be magical. \n\nAre there any other hardware developers that are designing consumer electronics?

    "selftext": "Are you feeling overwhelmed by what to include in your seed-stage pitch deck? You\u2019re not alone. Many founders struggle to tell their story clearly and effectively.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify it. After working with dozens of startups and VCs, I\u2019ve learned exactly what it takes to make a compelling deck\u2014especially at the seed stage. Here's what you actually need:\n\n# A. Start With the 10/20/30 Rule\n\nThis classic rule by Guy Kawasaki still holds up:\n\n* 10 slides max (15 if absolutely necessary)\n* 20 minutes to present\n* 30-point font size minimum\u2014if you need smaller text, you're saying too much\n\nKeep it short, sharp, and visually clean. Investors don\u2019t want a novel\u2014they want clarity and confidence.\n\n# B. The 10 Must-Have Slides for Your Deck\n\nYour pitch deck should tell a compelling, logical story. Here\u2019s the slide-by-slide breakdown:\n\n1. Cover Slide\n2. Problem\n3. Solution\n4. Traction\n5. Team\n6. Market Size\n7. Competition\n8. Business Model\n9. Go-to-Market Strategy\n10. The Ask\n11. Contact Slide (Optional but recommended)\n\nBonus: Appendix (If Needed)\n\n# C. Keep It Simple. Make It Memorable.\n\nMany founders overload their decks with jargon and complexity. Don\u2019t.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t need to be experts in your field\u2014they just need to understand the problem, the solution, and why you\u2019re the one to solve it.\n\n# D. Sequence Matters\n\nStructure your deck so your strongest points come first. You want to grab attention early. That said, always begin with the problem and end with the ask.\n\n# E. Final Thoughts\n\nYour pitch deck is your startup\u2019s story\u2014told in just 10 slides. Make it clear. Make it compelling. And most of all, make the investor believe you are the right person to build this company.",

Hard, declarative, controversial or attention getting opening.\n2. Tell me a story instead of showing me a check the box series of slides\n3. A story has a climax.  Have one.  Where do we find out in your story that Rosebud was the sled?\n4. A hard, declarative close that is a call to action and tells you are done (especially if presenting).",

Additionally, your further endorsing the mistake that most founders never get - a pitch deck is almost never \u201cpitched\u201d. 99% of the time investors are reading your deck in like 2 mins. Slide titles need to read like a story. You don\u2019t get to talk against it. Also there are plenty of successful pitch decks that don\u2019t have problem statements, but you do you I guess!",

Again, because of the vast nature of the venture, the actual outcome is that no one will see you and you'll be frustrated at the bill at the end. \n\nIf you do go, scout the areas where people are not selling (bars...), and go and chat to randomers there who \"look the part\" type thing to hope you find a bigger fish.

Found better luck with smaller, more curated networks and just asking other founders directly who they'd recommend.\n\nFor the soft skills vetting - we've started doing more scenario-based stuff rather than just behavioral questions.

    "selftext": "Your trial-to-paid conversion is probably like 10-15% or less.I work with various startups and most of their onboarding flows are done completely backwards.The companies hitting 50%+ conversion? They figured out one thing that everyone else misses. Time-to-value\n\nMost SaaS onboarding looks like this: sign up, watch tutorial videos, fill out your profile, take a product tour, configure different settings, maybe experience value on day 3, trial expires and user ghosts you\n\nI saw a project management tool make new users watch a 12-minute video about Gantt charts before they could create their first project. Twelve minutes! I've seen relationships end faster than that.\n\nDropbox doesn't explain file syncing. You install it, drag a file into the folder, and boom it shows up on your phone. Magic happens in 30 seconds.\n\nLoom doesn't teach you about screen recording theory. You click record, capture something, and immediately see the shareable link. Value delivered before you even realize what happened.\n\nThe mistake we all make we think users need to understand our entire product before getting value, this is backwards thinking. They need to get value before they'll invest time understanding your product.\n\nTime yourself signing up for your own trial. How long until you experience genuine value? Not understanding or setup completion - actual value. If it's more than 5 minutes, you're bleeding potential customers.\n\nIf you want to fix it move all the profile setup until after first value. Smart defaults instead of configuration, skip the product tour initially.\n\nAsk one question during signup: \"What do you want to accomplish?\" Then show them that specific thing working immediately.\n\nYou need to stop teaching people how to use your tool and start helping them get results with your tool",

Show, don\u2019t explain.",

      "Totally resonate with this. We\u2019re building an onboarding platform and talk to dozens of SaaS teams each month.\n\nProduct owners often feel this pressure to explain everything right after sign-up. But for most end-users, that just overwhelms them. They are rarely interested in an all-in-one solution, they signed up to solve a specific problem.\n\nThe most successful teams we see flip the script: start with the job-to-be-done. Guide the user to their first win, only then expand the product story. One thing at a time.",
      "This is spot-on. We've made this exact mistake with our own product - front-loading all the setup instead of getting users to their 'aha moment' first. One thing we'd add: track your activation metrics ruthlessly. We started measuring time-to-first value and realized our 'quick setup' was taking users 18 minutes on average. Now we focus on one core action that delivers immediate value, then progressively reveal features. The psychology is simple - people need to feel successful before they'll invest time learning. Great framework for auditing any onboarding flow.\u00a0"

You can't get user data unless you have a product that brings in users.  You need something to first get users in the door.  Companies who are literally AI first are often the ones to fail, even when their ideas are great, because they can't get the prerequisite initial user data.

Then and only then can you start talking about being AI driven and \"AI first\" and all of that.  It comes down to having a foundation before building a house.  It takes usually a minimum of two years of solid data collection from a decent number of customers, then you need the runway to build the AI / ML service that locks your customer base in.

Left because I couldn't convince myself we were actually solving something that mattered. Felt like we were making problems out of non-problems because we needed revenue, we needed the startup to succeed.\n\nI\u2019m not cynical. I like coding, I love building, and I\u2019ll probably keep building either way. But I really want to find a problem that's actually worth solving.\u00a0Something I can look at and think \"yeah, this needs to exist\" and then completely lose myself in building it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that products people pay for aren\u2019t valuable.

Well, yeah, kinda, as the internet and computers got bigger.\n\nDid we need social media?  Probably not, but now we do.  And did we need a million different social media apps?\n\nBasically, you don't need to solve a huge problem to build something cool. Just make something you like and figure out who needs it.\n\nLike, an app that scans candy and tells you where it's from? Super niche, right? But with some work, you could make it big.

I sketched out other ideas but none of them stuck. Then out of nowhere I got hit with something that actually felt solid. It was deep tech, way outside what I knew, and I had no clue how to build it.\n\nSpent a couple weeks getting the idea into shape. Ordered some Arduino parts to throw together a dirty proof of concept. More importantly, I started asking people who might actually need this if it was even worth building. Straight up asked if this solved anything for them, or if it was just noise. I wanted to know before I put in real time and effort.\n\nIf it lands, I\u2019ll keep building versions until it works the way I want. If not, I\u2019ll drop it. But at least I\u2019ll know I aimed at something real.\n\nMy advice is to keep your eyes open. Look at the stuff around you that doesn\u2019t work. Or the big stuff that feels too far away to touch. You don\u2019t have to fix the whole thing. Just move one piece. That can be enough.\n\nI also threw the idea into ChatGPT and asked for real pushback. No praise, just holes. It helped.

      "I think that there's a lot of misunderstanding about what the word \"problem\" actually means in an entrepreneurial sense. Yes, it can mean a real, felt problem. But it can also be something that people don't think about, or aren't aware of, because they've never seen how their lives could be improved because of it.\n\nThe iPod was like that. If you had asked people what they wanted to improve their mobile music experience, they probably would have said a longer cassette tape, or maybe better gap skip technology. Very few people realized that there were a set of technologies that existed, which, if combined and packaged correctly, could radically change the mobile music experience.\n\nLikewise, Facebook and Instagram weren't solving pressing, widely impactful problems. Their founders recognized that there were some things that people already liked to do but could do a whole lot better in the digital environment (looking at the freshman directory to find field that they might want to date, or sharing vacancy photos respectively) . This pretty much describes just about every tech product you can think of - there aren't people sitting around thinking if only I could do this. There are people not doing something that they would probably love to do if they only knew they could do it.\n\nThis is why entrepreneurship requires vision. You have to understand enough about how the world works and the compromises that we all accept as inevitable to envision a world without those compromises.\n\nThis is why engineers often don't make the best entrepreneurs, at least in this age of consumer focused products. Engineers think in terms of \"here's a problem, let me figure out a way to solve it.\" That's an inherently concrete exercise. Artists, philosophers, writers, and other liberal arts types, on the other hand, are much more versed in using their imagination to think about things that might be. That's why we make good founders.",
      "This is EXACTLY the challenge I faced before starting Scattermind.\n\n\n\nI was a non-technical founder stuck in \"observer mode\" for years. What finally broke me out of it was shifting from \"cool idea hunting\" to \"painful problem hunting\" - specifically in areas where I had firsthand experience.\n\n\n\nFor me, that was ADHD entrepreneurs struggling to execute consistently. I didn't just observe this problem, I LIVED it. I'd missed meetings, couldn't stick to schedules, and actually had a whole team abandon a project because of my execution issues.\n\n\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n\n\n1. Focus on problems in domains you deeply understand (even if they seem \"boring\"). Your software engineering background gives you insider knowledge on pain points most people miss.\n\n\n\n2. Pay attention to things people complain about repeatedly AND are actively trying to solve. The key question isn't \"is this annoying?\" but \"are people already spending time/money trying to fix this?\"\n\n\n\n3. Have actual conversations (not surveys). When I finally started talking to other ADHD entrepreneurs, I discovered they were spending thousands on coaches, courses and tools trying to solve execution problems.\n\n\n\nHere's the litmus test I use now: Can you name 5 specific people who have this problem so badly they'd pay you today if you had a solution? If not, keep digging.\n\n\n\nThe biggest mindshift was realizing that finding customers with hair-on-fire problems is much harder than building the product. Once I found that painful problem (execution issues for neurodiverse entrepreneurs), scaling from 0 to profitability happened surprisingly quickly.\n\n\n\nHope that helps!

      "Howzy founders,\n\ni will not promote.\n\n\n\nTHIS WILL BE A \\*\\*NO NONSENSE GUIDE FOR GULLIBLE FOUNDERS\\*\\* (ESP NON TECHNICAL ONES) ON HOW TO HIRE, WHERE TO HIRE AND HOW TO IMPROVE CASHFLOW AND VALUATIONS FOR EVERY DEV YOU HIRE.\n\n\n\nHiring is one of those things which seem easy at first (esp in this market), but then as you post jobs on linkedin / indeed, you take a few interviews and you realise how AWFUL the quality (coding skills) + communication skills of most of the devs is.\n\n\n\nI have taken \\*\\*300+ tech interviews\\*\\*, worked \\*\\*10+ years\\*\\* in the industry with devs from US to Kazakhstan to India. Here are some of my findings for Startup founders -\n\n\n\n\\\\- 15% devs outright lie about a language / framework. Its awkward in interviews(what's the point ?)\n\n\n\n\\\\- 25%+ devs cheat using some AI tool. I ALWAYS ask them to share their entire screen.\n\n\n\n\\\\- 70+ are NOT able to explain the business impact of the code they are writing\n\n\n\n\\\\- If there is something to be clarified from the Design / Project Manager, 80% of devs hesitate to simply ask for a clarification\n\n\n\n\\\\- the existing devs in a company have some weird complex about obscure knowledge nitbits they are sitting on and hesitate to share it with new joinees (so that they aren't fired)\n\n\n\n\\\\- In certain cultures (like india), the devs are subservient to their seniors, so much so that \\*\\*they won't even raise an obvious red flag in a meeting\\*\\* (its like titanic - those who knew the ship would sink did nothing about it). THIS IS CRAZY FOR YOU (AS A FOUNDER).\n\n\n\n\\\\- Devs obsess about status and badly want to get into FAANGs. \n\n\n\n  FAANGs use Leetcode for hiring. \n\n\n\n  So everyone and their grandma now uses leetcode for hiring(these are puzzle questions related to   data structure optimization).  \n\n  \n\n95% OF THE WORK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH \\*\\*OBSCURE LEETCODE QUESTIONS\\*\\* BUT SIMPLY PUTTING DATA IN AND OUT OF WEBSITES, DATABASES AND BUILDING PIPELINES FOR IT, THAT'S IT.\n\n\n\n\\\\- Adding to the previous point, since devs openly cheat on these leetcode questions, the leetcode difficulty went from easy to medium to hard. So now, most decent devs who just code on business problems and not play around with leetcode puzzles (like me) simply can't clear the interview rounds.   \n\n  \n\nAnd the ones that do clear (assuming they haven't cheated), struggle to create website carousels and todolists (real world tasks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\*\\*NOT EVERYTHING IS DOOM AND GLOOM, LETS TALK ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS :\\*\\*\n\n\n\n  \n\nTalk to devs like they are normal human beings, avoid the ones who are socially awkward, ask them about business impact they have created and how can soon can they create 1m USD profits for your startup. How would they do that ?\n\n\n\n\\*\\*For the love of God, don't ask them leetcode questions\\*\\*, if you are hiring for frontend (react, angular), ask them to code a simple counter or todolist (70% of react devs fail here). \\*\\*The devs need to be constantly thinking about making you richer even while they are making love to their girlfriend).\\*\\* \n\n\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*Hire internationally.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nOne 22 yr guy founder I know raised 200k USD pre seed to build craigslist for trucks. He can't code, he is based in NYC and is looking to hire junior devs at 120k USD salary. Add to that, his own modest living expenses (VCs hate that founders HAVE TO SURVIVE), he will \\*\\*burn through the funds in a year\\*\\*.\n\n\n\nThen what ? \n\n\n\nequity value is zero. \n\n\n\nVCs are sad. \n\n\n\nFounder lost his precious youth trying to get product - market fit, etc. \\*\\*good luck trying to get boomer truck drivers to pay 20 USD for listing their 6 figure truck\\*\\*.\n\n\n\nHe should have hired a MVC Agency is Southeast Asia / Eastern EU / India / Pak / Bangladesh who would have coded the entire website + app in \\*\\*15k USD. Spend the remaining amount getting traction (read the book by the same name), personally meet the truck drivers, click the photos of their trucks and hand out physical flyers to boomer drivers.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI would try to get a list of all the truck drivers in Amrikka, send this flyer to them in physical mail (could be 3 USD / mail). Send to 10k drivers (30k USD), atleast 500 will install the app and list their truck for free (lower if its paid).\n\n\n\nOr just run online ads. Boomers click on it, Zoomers don't.\n\n\n\nFor larger startups, get into \\*\\*long term contracts\\*\\* with agencies or devs from third world where they can live like a king for 40k USD a year instead of hiring some 120k USD US zoomer who feels awkward turning on webcam in the daily standup. \n\n\n\nThe \\*\\*80k USD to 100k USD you save every year is cold hard cash sitting in your bank account\\*\\*. Imagine that for every hire you make. \n\n\n\nAlso, the chances of startup survival goes up from 10% to over 50%, \\*\\*the valuations go up about 700k USD to 1.2m USD for every international hire\\*\\* (because of lower burn rates).\n\n\n\nAs founders, you can negotiate next rounds like a boss instead of a hostage situation.\n\n\n\nThese are just some of my thoughts, let me know what you guys think !

    "selftext": "So, I\u2019m an investor in early-stage startups who goes through an absurd amount of pitches in a day, and a common problem I see is founders don\u2019t know at what stage they are ready to be raising a round of funding, so I\u2019m making this post to help.\n\nYou more than likely can\u2019t raise with just an idea. period.\n\nIdeally, as a founder, you need to push the fundraising process as far as you can so you get the best possible terms for your startup, so what you need to do is figure out how long you can survive with your existing resources and start the fundraising process ~6 months before you need money.\n\nKeep your spending to a minimum in the meantime.\n\nI think raising funds is way too glamorized in the startup community, and in my opinion, it\u2019s silly to celebrate it.\n\nIf you\u2019re a startup thinking of raising money, what an investor is thinking is - \u201cIf I give this person capital, what\u2019s the likelihood that they succeed and give me a massive return?\u201d\n\nHow can you show that to an investor? Not by showing your credentials, how great your idea is, and shallow displays of confidence (I had a guy tell me his competitors don\u2019t have a chance purely because he\u2019s entering the market).\n\nIt\u2019s by showing signs of traction. Build just enough features to solve a painful problem, and get them to use it. Even having 20-30 users is gonna significantly improve your chances over pitching with just an amazing idea.\n\nRaising money is to pour gasoline on the fire, not to start one.\n\nAlso, keep your ask to the bare minimum to get to your next milestone (generally ~10-12 months burn). Anything more will make it more difficult on yourself.\n\nidea + sizeable market + signs of traction or proof of your idea working and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nLet me know if you need any help or some honest feedback on your startup!",

      "10-12 months burn really? It used to be 12-18 months. Now with all funding rounds being pushed out it\u2019s advisable it\u2019s even longer 24-36 months. \n\nIt\u2019s the founder\u2019s job to know their business, not the investors\u2019.",
      "Founder here. This is the perspective I have quickly shifted to, just 3 months after starting out and after a couple of conversations with VCs (not serious pitches, no decks involved). \n\n  \nThere are a lot of trade-offs involved in starting something as I have quickly realized, and it's basically a good series of trade-offs compounding that makes a successful startups. Fund-raising too early is really costly because a huge amount of effort is involved, that could have been used to build faster and get more traction.",
      "Is this depending on the business type? \n\nWhat if the business is a combo of hardware/software that is newly invented? \n\nIt would be pretty capital intensive to build out prototypes for proof of concept, would having some software completed be good enough traction? \n\nOr would it need to be heavily validated and 100% proven for early backing?\n\nOr is this all nuance and it depends on investor and his thoughts/personal views about your business?",
      "What most founders don\u2019t realize is that \u201ctraction\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean revenue\u2014it could be:\n\n* LOIs from serious customers\n* A waitlist of early adopters who\u2019ve *committed* to paying\n* A viral GTM loop that\u2019s driving free inbound\n* Or even a niche market where you\u2019ve nailed distribution, and need capital to scale ops\n\nOne trick that\u2019s helped founders I work with is building a \u201cproof stack\u201d in the pitch: a short section where you visually layer early traction, unit economics, and conviction signals (like an advisor roster or strategic partner) to create a narrative that screams: *we\u2019re already moving, your capital just accelerates it.*\n\nMost decks are missing that entirely.",

They just need to survive the mirror. \n\nNot trying to be cynical, just saying that most poeple raise to avoid the pain of real validation. \n\nTraction should feel inevitable. Not performative. And if it dies the moment you stop tweeting about it..... well, that tells you everything.\n\nThe sad part is that many have actually built fire, but they just don't know where the real oxygen is yet.",

A lot of founders I've spoken in the past have normally given me a range. \n\nI am not an investor, but I used to connect investors with founders looking to raise funds. And most of the time, founders used to tell me they need between \"$500-800k\" or \"$1m-2m\". \n\nIf you are a serious founder looking to raise funds, you will have calculated how much money you actually need and what that money will be used for.",

Build just enough features to solve a painful problem, and get them to use it. Even having 20-30 users is gonna significantly improve your chances over pitching with just an amazing idea.\n\nThis is where I differ. The problem is making mountains out of a mole hill. People will post a survey, get three or six or twelve people to respond, then ask if that is enough 'market traction' to launch. They are being ridiculous. \n\nDelusions about the barest flicker of interest meaning validation or traction is *the major problem.* If fewer people indulged the delusionary behavior it wouldn't thrive and grow.\n\nTo the eventual point that over these last months I have seen several discussions about skipping validation entirely, which are the fruits of enabling. What investors need to know is they are getting what they deserve. People would never discuss skipping validation otherwise.\n\nYour post isn't bad, but it doesn't really discuss validation or traction but dances around some serious issues.

Metrics, business models, market fit, etc. are very important, but this is the second thing to pay attention to.\n\nWe build our due diligence on the assessment of signals that tell us whether this founder and team can build a business, what their vision is, what their values are, what the roadmap is, etc. Before the numbers, we identify inconsistencies. We would like to understand from the very beginning whether there is *Founder Product Fit*\n\n**The biggest problem is misalignment.**   \n  \nI constantly have to see how businesses fail. They had great metrics, they were growing fast, they were getting investments, and then a year or three later, everything collapses.

Everybody want's to see revenue.  To get to revenue we need more than 10 times that amount of money.  It involves hiring a hand full of people so I can't even comment on how long it will take them, and we are likely to be subject to as of yet unknown regulatory burdens depending on where exactly the revenue comes from.    In my situation, the margins are huge.  Once we get to revenue we don't really need investments.\n\nIt's an existing market we are trying to break into.

      "You dont and probably many dont but many investors have backed an idea. I worked for a startup that got $5M on an idea. As a founder, you are putting your time into building a team and the company. You can easily break up a 1M seed into 2-4 tranches to reduce risk.\u00a0\nBuilding is easy and in B2B connection are not worth as much as people generally say. I have been on both sides and I will tell you that it doesn\u2019t matter if you have personal connection. On the business side, we are still going to evaluate ruthlessly. You being a startup is a riskeven if the product looks good because you may be dead in a year. If you show us something new, then we will go to market for that and evaluate the options. You get a thanks for the suggestion and a chance to demo. If you have 10 million in funding, then we are more likely to consider you as a vendor.\n\nA decent amount of funding actually gives you a chance to build and get some traction before seeking more funding. Risk averse investors are more likely to just invest in whole bunch of startups that go nowhere. Remember the market is changing all the time there are more and more products, so the criteria for \u201cvalue\u201d is getting higher. Your customers also know that AI can generate an MVP so they will want to know what it is that you\u2019re actually providing that is of value. How do they know that you\u2019re gonna be around tomorrow?\n\nIf you have a year or less runway, as a enterprise, we wont even consider you. Not even for a free product because nothing is free.

      "This is spot on. The \"just an idea\" pitch is something I see way too often, and it almost never works.\n\nThe traction piece is huge - but here's what I'd add from working with 100+ early stage founders: most people confuse \"signs of traction\" with vanity metrics. \n\n20-30 users who actually pay you (even if its just $5/month) beats 1000 free signups every single time. Revenue, even tiny amounts, proves someone values what you built enough to pay for it.\n\nAlso agree on the timing aspect. Starting fundraising when you're already running out of money is a rookie mistake. You negotiate from a position of weakness and usually end up taking whatever terms you can get.\n\nOne thing I'd add - before you even think about fundraising, make sure you actually have product-market fit. Too many founders raise money to \"figure out\" their market. That's backwards. Figure out PMF first, then raise to scale what's already working.\n\nWe actually created Sprint Zero at Wednesday Solutions specifically for this - helping founders get clarity on their market and traction before they waste time (and equity) raising money for the wrong thing.\n\nThe fire analogy is perfect. You can't pour gasoline on something that isn't already burning.",

Generally I\u2019ve avoided raising, so this is new to me, however we are confident a pre-seed raise is necessary in this case. We likely couldn\u2019t afford to bring it all online at once and this particular market demands a full suite of integrated apps before adoption. So my questions to the OP are:\n\nCan \u201ctraction\u201d be properly demonstrated with a waiting list?\nShould we have a basic prototype that potential investors can play with?\nWe can\u2019t make the first critical hire without funding, but they\u2019re onboard if it\u2019s funded - is that okay to bring up?",
      "My buddy is the only company in America building the infrastructure for flying taxis and can\u2019t raise funding. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to help him and introduced him to every VC firm I know but they just won\u2019t pull the trigger.\n\nThis is massive multibillion if not trillion dollar future industry.\n\nFAA is allowing flights starting next year and there\u2019s tons of aerospace companies making the evtols themselves but no one is making the software to control the things or the landing and take off infrastructure to operate them which is what my friends company actually does. They have actual contracts to build these things but again no will fund it.\n\nChina and Saudi Arabia have already been testing and building out their infrastructure. China\u2019s way ahead of us actually. \n\nTrump just signed an executive order to help get this industry off the ground.\n\nYet VCs won\u2019t fund it. This should be investors wet dream - flying cars are actually here, 10-100x return likely but they are all too afraid to invest? Why?",

      "Seems like decent advice. Good management practices are largely about mitigating or managing risk. How you do that will depend on your own situation and what the business does.\n\nIn my own experience, prioritization is foundational and key. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1) You can go through the due diligence process of validating or invalidating ideas with various customers. Build, iterate, and release. The innovation process can generally be reduced to a procedure if you\u2019re willing and able to spend the time on it. It\u2019s a very conservative approach.\n\n2) At a startup, you generally don\u2019t have the \u201cable\u201d part. The process can take way too long or cost too much, especially if you\u2019re going into an industry cold and aren\u2019t familiar with the customer. People will typically make a bunch of assumptions (i.e., risks) to accelerate the process. \n\n3) A good prioritizer will understand which risks to manage and how much, while understanding how to adapt their offering for multiple customer segments. Don\u2019t spend time polishing rocks or non-value added tasks. It takes good judgement to determine when you\u2019ve milked the value.\n\nSide note: I worked with a co-founder who got some advice and was steadfast in following it. The advice was that startups should only focus on one thing at a time. There\u2019s a lot to unpack from that advice. He took it very seriously and was opposed to multi-tasking. This led to a lot of wasted time polishing rocks for one customer, and he spent no time, not even down time, on other things we needed to get done. It affects everyone when a key team member does not have good judgement.",
      "You\u2019re detaching the risk from the progress towards the outcome. I would be prepared to risk everything as long as I was obtaining tangible evidence that what I was doing was working.

    "title": "Why you can\u2019t afford misalignment - I will not promote",
    "selftext": "TL;DR: I now ask every early-stage hire, \"What would a successful chapter here look like for you, personally?\" It filters out the job-seekers and finds the people who want to bet on this with me.\n\nWhen I started my company, I had two honest motivations: solve a real problem, and yes, drastically improve my own financial situation. I don't come from money. There's no family safety net, no trust fund to fall back on. Every decision, especially early hires, is incredibly high-stakes.\nIn the beginning, I hired based on what seemed like the right criteria:\n-Strong skills? Check.\n-Good energy? Check.\n-Cultural fit (aka vibe check)? Check.\t\nIt all sounded great, but it wasn't nearly enough. I was missing the one question that would have saved me so much time, frustration, and drag:\n\n\"A few years from now, what would need to have happened for you to look back and say, 'This was a massive personal success for me'?\"\n\nWhy this is more important than any resume:\nWe hired people who were objectively talented, but their internal compass was pointed in a completely different direction than ours.\n-Candidate 1: Was looking for structure, predictability, and a 9-to-5 \"work-life balance.\" We were in full-blown, unfiltered chaos mode. It was never going to work.\n-Candidate 2: Was intellectually curious, but couldn't care less about the outcome. To them, it was an interesting project. To us, it was our entire future.\n-Candidate 3: Cared about doing good work but didn't buy into the broader vision at all. Every strategic decision turned into a painful negotiation.\nThese weren't bad hires. They were misaligned hires. And that misalignment slowly poisoned everything:\n-Different priorities\n-Different pace\n-Low resilience when things got tough\n\nAnd you know who made the biggest impact in the end? Not the one with the most experience. It was the person who said in their interview:\n\"If this thing works, it changes my life, too.\"\nWhat we do differently now:\n1. No more juniors in the very beginning. Sorry, but in the early stages, we need people who can swim on their own, not potential that we don't have the time to nurture.\n2. We talk bluntly about personal goals. Where do you want to go in life? Does this path help you get there\n3. Alignment > Everything else. Enthusiasm is great, skills are crucial. But at the end of the day, we all need to be running in the same direction.\n\nMy takeaway: A startup isn't a job. It's a bet. And when I'm putting everything on the line, I can't afford to have people on the team who are playing a different game.\n\nYou can teach skills. You have to share a direction.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Maybe you can share your experience with misalignment in the comments.\n",

If a regular employee goes there, they figure a startup is a good place to hide from the job market. \n\nA startup isn't a job. It is a bunch of delusional unemployed people ...else they would have called them businesses, day one. A startup is properly defined as an economic experiment to prove a business model. Startups are *out of business* and trying to get in. Want to get everybody's head screwed on straight -- start with that. \n\nWay too many founders are trying to develop a reality distortion field, not a business nor a product. They hire for belief -- mostly because their own is so shaky -- even a particle of reality blows them to smithereens like antimatter. \n\nThat may be why founders expect so much from people *they are paying with monopoly money, vague job descriptions* and *precious little management*. If you people can't inspire with a compelling, detailed, vision ...there is less than nothing to offer. Coping isn't management. Self-inflicted chaos is not a culture.\n\nI suggest more founders call it recruiting rather than hiring ...much like a cult. Then more people will be on the same page. To qualify as the kind of person you now look for, their first question won't be about work-life balance but product-market fit. That will be an even more awkward discussion to have.",

This is even IF you follow every guideline about doing it off the side with no employer resources etc.  \n\nThe corollary is that by that point, your company can hire legal to argue the opposite, showing that you followed all guidelines blah blah.\n\nThere are nonzero risks to everything related to the above, if your current work and your side gig are in the same industry / domain, then it's likely mostly on the IP side. \n\nMy recommendation is to read your employment letter very carefully since you're based out of California, because aside from IP, one of the few types of \"non-compete\" that is valid in California is restrictions on soliciting the same clients for the same work after you leave the company, and that can extend for up to a year or more.",

So if you are building a software product, even if you are employed for software there is nothing they cant claim from you\n-  Contract obligations. Companies love to make up contract clauses.

What type of entity to create and when has definite tax implications that are hard to answer in a Reddit comment. Happy to discuss if you DM.\n\nOf course, the big questions are: 1) what state are you in; and 2) what does your employment agreement say?

And after that, I think you get a bit of wiggle room, but it solely depends on the type of your startup and service and other stuff. So from my experience -  It depends on the system. After one or two months, you will learn a lot of things, you will build some processes, and you will create some basic automations too that will help you or give you a little bit of wiggle room. After being a founder for six months, I think it is important to work hard, invest solely on what you are building, but breathe, take a break. It is important. I mean, you are not going to be burn out that first, but it impacts on the creativity, clear thinking. So what I have done is like I manage my work responsibilities and everything in such a way that now I have one day weekend. So one day every week, I simply try to stay away from work unless something is burning or someone is dead. After following this for two months, I have seen significant improvement in the quality of my work and decision making. So in general, it's going to be tough, but you have to create a system or processes that suits you. You have to celebrate small wins.

    "selftext": "For a lot of startup founders, especially in the early stages, sourcing products through Alibaba seems like a no-brainer. The prices look good, you can talk directly with suppliers, and there's a lot of flexibility even for small orders.\n\nBut something I've noticed and heard often is that people get caught off guard by the costs that don't show up on the product page. They're not always big on their own, but together, they can mess with your budget if you're not prepared.\n\nOne example: if your goods arrive and you're not ready to receive them, you might be charged for storage at the port or by the logistics company. It's not something most people think about when placing a small test order.\n\nAlso, depending on what you're importing, like skincare, electronics, or baby items, there might be rules on safety documents or test results. Some founders find out too late that they need paperwork before the shipment clears.\n\nIn certain countries, even trial shipments may need you to register as an importer first. It's not always as simple as just \"ordering and waiting.\"\n\nNone of this is a reason to avoid sourcing internationally. But if you're building a product brand and testing demand with a small batch, it's worth asking a few more questions before you click \"buy.\"\n\nI'm curious if others here have gone through this; what costs or steps surprised you in the early days?

I had this problem with a startup i managed, the founders had started with a venture studio. The venture studio obviously ended up being useless and dumb, and after two years the founders were forced to leave, relaunch a company, and go through 3 years of lawsuit to finally be able to breath and own their work.\n\nNot worth it. Go find angel investors. If no one else is interested in giving you 100K, then change the business idea or force it going bootstrapped, but if you can\u2019t convince anyone else to give you 100K, that\u2019s not really a good sign. You could still make it of course, but will probably take time so better to do on your own.\n\nIf you don\u2019t control the company what\u2019s the point, might as well be an employee somewhere and not all that work and pressure.",

But let's be real, you don't have control of your company. \n\nThey take a risk on an unproven founder with 100k usd. They want the ability to get rid of you if things don't work out. Generally a venture studio will insist on founder vesting and cliff periods, and with 60% of the equity they can outvote you on any shareholder resolutions. This means that if things don't go well you could walk away with nothing. \n\nWhich again is ok if you don't have another option. You have to get founders' experience somewhere, and if your options are no funding or rough terms, take rough terms. \n\nBut be aware with 60%, they are the founder, you're the cofounder.\n\nIf I wanted to work with them, I might go back and tell them that I get the 60% and they get the 40%, because otherwise you're not really the main founder and this could cause trouble with future investment rounds.\n\nAnother thing you absolutely need to clarify that isn't clear from your description:\n\nAre they saying \"we give you 100k in 2 installments. In exchange we get 60% of the startup\"\n\nor are they saying \"we give you 30k and in exchange we get 60% of the startup, and we give you another 70k later and will negotiate additional equity for that amount later.\"\n\nIn the second case, you're going to end up really diluted. It'll end up being more like a job where you work for them than a company you own.\n\nWhich again, is ok if you need the income and experience, but just have your eyes open to what you're getting into.",

Also, if you can then raise SAFE agreements, the best way, negotiate for dilution of equity in these, you are good to go and they will get their equity only when a certain valuation cap hits. Secondly, don\u2019t get trapped into convertible notes, it is good but only when you read all clauses, many founders don\u2019t read it and eventually you sign up for a clause that restricts all your movements from raising capital to funding, also little difficult to service the debt.\n\nPs: I work in the valuation domain.

      "For background, I run a venture studio in Austin Texas. Venture studios operate differently from a normal venture fund, angel investor, or startup incubator. A venture studio's main value proposition is heavier support and a team of experts that make your idea a reality. They usually take a high equity stake and or a vested stake at each stage the startup goes through where they rely on the studio (either as a bill back on services rendered, an in-kind investment of services for equity, or money and services for equity)\n\nRead [Venture Studios Demystified](https://a.co/d/jbcsWCP) (it's a quick read) for a better understanding of the structural and financial requirements and best practices so you can more effectively negotiate with them. Specifically, look at pages 83-85 ( only 4 of the 19 studios interviewed for the book took more than 50% common equity) and page 107 ( a financial model that models the dilution of the studio from a 30% stake) \n\nSome thoughts that are specific to MY approach in my studio so might not be relevant to your situation:\nRealistically you are being hired as an EIR with a good idea (worth very little in their eyes) and what they want is you. So for example what I am always looking for is someone I can be confident can take one of our 9 current solutions for the problems we are solving and as quickly as possible validate them, (problem, customer need, value props, pricing, marketing, etc) hit PmF and scale to a 10m to 100 mil evaluation and sell it. And then come back and rinse and repeat. The way I run mine is high equity with vesting from the team at pre-identified gates. So we pay our staff a salary and own the ideas they generated at our idea jam, we own the idea at incubation and they vest out 60% of equity (split amongst their Exec team and employee option pools). Idea generation and incubation take about 3 months total, 9 months for the first tranche of vesting ( we count this as year one) then a normal 3 more years of vesting to their 60% equity. Acceleration vests to 100% of contracted shares at sale. Vesting tranches are based on a predetermined set of ours and KPIs at each stage designed by the entire studio and startup team to get them to an A round. If they don't meet their OKRs and KPIs we as a studio leadership team decide if it was the idea or the team and recycle or get rid of the individual team members as needed. If we fire someone and anytime in 365 days after their firing we sell the company they vest 100% of their shares. If we sell on day 366 they only get the shares they had vested to that point. Every staff member of the studio gets equity-based profit sharing in the studio on a 4-year vesting with a year cliff Agreement. So they might go through 4 companies in our studio with no wins but someone else in our studio sells their company for 100 million, a portion of that sale goes to our studio, and a portion of that portion goes to the entire staff as a bonus for that year.\n\nThe major differentiators for my studio are the problems we choose to focus on, the support we offer, and the EIRs in my stable. I think of my studio as an up-and-coming minor-league sports team. I am looking for superstar players who can help me win at each stage and I will bring on and get rid of players based on their performance. A player with a track record of performance is worth more to me than someone with no track record. If they come with experience, track record AND they have already taken an idea through one of our decision gates ( is the idea business worthy, is the product a good fit for the market, is the company a good fit for the industry, etc.) I am willing to pay more in either salary or equity. (usually equity because it's not money from my coffers)\n\nI am willing to bring on an EIR with an existing idea that fits are thesis if (and only if) I feel confident that he is addicted not to his idea or solution but to building companies. Because more than likely his idea is going to shit the bed and I want an EIR I can recycle back into our ideation, incubation acceleration process for a new idea not someone who is going to suffer from sunk cost fallacy. In that scenario what I am looking to do is buy that expertise and learning as opposed to the EIRs I am training from new MBAs or ex-consulting status who are learning how to run the scientific lean startup approach and churn through our problem sets for new solutions to take to market. So if a startup founder came to me with an idea I would vet how early they were based on KPIs and questions answered. Based on that it would either slot them into our system with an equity agreement that fits where our teams would receive if they had achieved the same stage minus or plus about 10% based on how badly I wanted you versus the idea. (10% of a billion is worth more than 60% of 10 million)\n\nHope that helps.",

      "I'm well versed in the venture studio model. A couple things:\n\n1. 60% is on the high side, but not unheard of for a heavy-touch venture studio.\n\n2. That doesn't make it smart, right, or fair.\n\nVenture studios can be great for deep tech or niche markets that will never scale to an IPO, but have a good shot of acquisition of M&A. The 60% ownership you lose at the beginning almost NEVER pencils out to being of benefit, but there are exceptions depending on answers to a few key questions:\n\n1. How long has the venture studio been running?\n\n2. How many successful exits do they have?\n\n3. Where are their EIRs sourced from? Reputable companies?\n\nIf you think it's HIGHLY likely they can aggressively bring your product to the market, maybe roll it into a corporate partner's portfolio, and drive a small (sub-$50M) exit on an accelerated timeline, then it might be a worthwhile deal. **If they don't have a very impressive track record, team, and corporate partners to support an accelerated exit, then don't do it.**",

SAFE/convertible note: Instead of straight equity, propose a SAFE with a reasonable valuation cap (e.g., $1 M) so you preserve upside if you hit it big.\n\n\n3. Milestone vesting: Push for their full equity stake to vest only as they deliver on agreed milestones (MVP, first customer, intro to advisors, etc.).\n\n\n4.

The name of the game right now is not to raise the most money, it's to reach Product Market Fit with as much equity intact as possible.

I used it from my friends vibrator business and she literally doubled her conversion rate over 2 weeks. It's insane what a difference it makes.\n\nBut on a deeper note - I'd focus on first having stronger differentiation at a product level as that trumps marketing.",

Consistent growth, great feedback, some big partnerships coming up.\n\nWe've been bootstrapping and recently raised about $20k in SAFEs which should get us through about 4 months. Looking to raise more from family and friends. We're interviewing with 2 VCs and an Accelerator. All of which reached out to us and encouraged us to apply.\n\nHonestly, I think we'll get accepted into the accelerator and I think from there we can land one of the VCs. But I don't want to rely on it and I want \"my pick of the litter\" so to say and get more favorable terms. Taking the opportunity to raise our Family and Friends round to keep the ball in our court.\n\nDid you do anything differently when asking family and friends than asking strangers? Did you post on social media or did you message anyone directly?\n\nMy immediate family does well but they financially support almost all of my entire extended family. I went to a kind of shitty state school with my partner so not too many high network alumni. Though we are going to alumni networking events and doing what we can to meet people, we aren't shy.\n\nBut you could say my personal network doesn't have a very high net worth (my partners is worse). How did you ask family and friends for money? I have a few people I can ask, but I'd like to land the plane. Honestly, it feels harder asking people I know than people I don't. And not because I don't believe or anything - if anything I'm very confident we'll get funding from a group / VC as well as other strangers, just feels more awkward. Never asked someone I know for money before.\n\nMy hope is to build momentum with family and friends and ride that momentum into some 2nd / 3rd connections and from there land the VC / Accelerators.\n\nAny advice?",

Customers would look at it and say \"that's really cool\", and walk away. It was amazing technology, but it was pretty clear nobody cared, because it didn't solve a problem people had.\n\nI'm trying on my own now.\n\n I took a problem I was having on my side business that I couldn't find a solution for and I'm building solution. I'm building a CAD solution for a specific industry and the difference is so substantial compared to the last SaaS I worked on. \n\nIt's interesting to me because if I didn't run a side business where I had this problem, I wouldn't understand the technical aspects of it. And if I didn't have a background in software, I wouldn't be able to build a complex CAD solution for it. So I feel like I'm at this weird apex of just the right place to solve this problem.\n\nI'd say about 70% of the customers we've met with are desperate to get access to it and have asked us for access to pre-releases or anything that we can make available. The other 30% aren't super technically savvy, so they look at it and you can see the gears turning about how they would use it, but it isn't as clear for them.\n\nIt's also exciting when you meet with potential customers and they realize very quickly that you suffer from this problem so you understand it deeply. And they're delighted to see that you're one step ahead of their thinking on how to solve it.\n\nIt's such a difference from the last startup. People have hunted my personal contact information down to ask about the product. \n\nIt's so clear that it solves a real problem, our big risk is the market size, I'm worried it's very small.",

I would say the number of people who have that and know how to build good software is vanishingly small, so one side needs to approach the other.

      "I'm someone who's always been on the sales/marketing/BD side of startups and just now getting into being a \"builder\", so my opinion may not matter. but seeing projects like \"notion but specifically for real estate agents\" or \"slack but for restaurants\" aren't necessarily a bad thing. one could argue that if there's a product with existing demand, that's a good sign, and you either differentiate with product or marketing. I'm sure that will piss off a lot of the purist builders out there, but we see it all the time -- the better product doesn't always win. I literally saw a Calendly \"clone\" that recently launched and focused its targeting on very specific verticals (it's a \"niche calendar scheduling app\") and is doing around $5k/MRR. its users could easily use Calendly. it's maybe 1% different. but it's gaining traction because the messaging seems to resonate with its audience\n\nBut here's where I agree with you: there are way too many people building solutions to problems that doesn't exist. \n\nYou're right, you shouldn't just build a \"slack for restaurants\" because you \"think\" restaurants need it. first you should validate if its a problem, do some research, etc. you might discover restaurants don't give a shit about a tool like slack...but they might be using notion mainly for its databases and wikis to manage recipes and menus...and there's not a better solution, so you could then \"unbundle\" that function from notion and build that. (this is just an example, probably a bad one, but hopefully gets to the point)\n\nI've been empowered by AI to start building things myself, and the first few projects I went off a tweet, some insight in a newsletter, or just a tingle in my balls, and sure enough, mostly crickets. my latest project I actually validated first with a waitlist and some outreach, and it get enough sign ups for me to make it. now I'm repositioning it to niche down even further, and maybe it works or maybe it dies. but I'll be honest, it was REALLY HARD to do the waitlist thing...I just wanted to build. but I'm glad I slowed down and attempted to validate it first",

      "Building for a problem you\u2019ve experienced firsthand is such a smarter approach. It\u2019s crazy how many founders miss that",
      "You're right that most ideas fail because the founder has never experienced the problem firsthand. If you have to convince yourself that the problem exists, it probably doesn't.\n\nI run a small health-tech startup focused on creating a less stressful cognitive test for seniors. We never sat around brainstorming \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. My dad struggled with the MoCA test in a clinic, walked out feeling embarrassed, and never returned. Three geriatricians I know told me they would use a less stressful option immediately if it were available. That was our green light. We secured our first ten pilot sites before we even wrote a single line of code.\n\nMy rule of thumb now is this:\n\nIf I can't call ten people who would be willing to swipe their card today, I shelve the idea. \n\nIf I need to run ads just to find out who is interested, I've already gotten my answer. \n\nIf a user's first reaction is \"cool,\" I move on. I aim for \"please build this and send me the invoice.\"\n\nPursuing a \"Slack-but-for-X\" idea is more of a hobby than a business. Focus on finding workflows that rely on WhatsApp and Excel, or walk away.",
      "I mean there are too schools of thought, the first is exactly what you said, having existing problems with customers who need it and want it. The second though is the problems that no one really is asking to be solved. \n\nI know plenty of sucessful startups in either boat. I think what you are really talking about is the people who are solving the non-ask problems and coming on here expressing how they are not getting traction or why their idea is special and no one is adopting it. That is the problem of the type of founder you are and also understanding the market dynamics are  100% different all the way from how you sell, market, price and package, outreach, get product features, etc. It takes a special kind of founder to really understand that and to your point I agree there are too many people thinking they are the next Steve Jobs with their idea and falling short. Conversely there are a lot of people who think they hacve a better product with better potential and existing fit but forget about things like how competition can keep you locked out. \n\nAn example like Palmer Lucky who no one was asking heavily for AR/VR and went for it and got bought out by Meta. Then there is Magic Leap who saw the success (even apple did this) and was like his startup got bought and I can do it x10000 better but clearly a **giant failure.** \n\nAnother example is Palantir, no one really knew that graph science/new analytics was necessary, their good old giant database (like teradata, exadata, even the cloudera/hortonworks) could solve intricate data analytics with the right queries. Then Palantir looked at it differently and brought data ingestion/graph analytics t the forefront and a new way of operating with forward deployed engineering. \n\nAnother is the founder of Zenefits realized the outdated T&E areas and for different reasons was right but failed then realized the problems are still there and re-did it with Rippling. \n\nAt the end of the day it really is on the founder to know what boat they are getting into and making sure how they understand the limitations but also how to get it to where it needs to go.",

    "selftext": "Just had a pretty wild first for my SaaS, and avoided a dispute!!\n\nThought the story might be worth sharing, to shed light on some tricky situations one can face...\n\nOne of our users was super active using my tool\u00a0for his company. He gave regular feedback, used the product often, and seemed very involved. A few weeks in, he asked to change the account email.\n\nFrom his company one to a personal email.\n\nHe had just paid for a yearly plan, so I didn\u2019t think twice. Seemed legit, and I switched it over.\n\nA few days later... I got an email from the same (company) email address. But it wasn\u2019t him.\n\nBut it was someone else. The signature said \"company CEO\"\n\nThe email said the employee was no longer with the company and had used the CEO\u2019s personal card to pay for the subscription. All without approval.\n\nThe tone was furious, written almost entirely in ALL CAPS.\n\nThe CEO demanded immediate cancellation and said she was already preparing to file a chargeback.\n\nNever ever i had seen such a use case ...\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1. Verified the payment card name. And indeed it was matching with CEO one.\n2. Change the email to the CEO one (who paid for it on behalf of company)\n3. Reset the password and cleared any personal identifiers\n\nOnce access was reset, I email the CEO calmy, saying it took a few hours for me to investigate as this was the first time such situation happened.\n\nI said I was able to confirm her identity and ownership, and gave her full access to the account\n\nThen I offered two simple options:\n\n1. Keep using the tool (already paid for at a discounted yearly rate)\n2. Or get a full refund\n\nI was already ready to write off that revenue. And surprisingly, she chose to keep using it.\n\nShe said she actually finds it useful and she was glad she could gain access (and ex-employee couldn't walk off with the SaaS. Now they're an active user themselves.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n* Always verify before changing key account details\n* Keep your cool, clear, fair communication goes a long way\n* Sometimes a dispute turns into a conversion.

No problem. His business approach (revealed after two bottles of whiskey) involves using unregulated Facebook ad accounts and AI-generated UGC videos and images. \n\nThe strategy is mapped out like this:\n\nIn the early stage, he focused on two primary funnels: \n1. an automated social outreach tool that reaches out to people's DM and asks if they have \"a problem and need fix\", \n2. Create a massive amount of creatives using AI tools like Creatify and ChatGPT. Then run them through disposable meta ad accounts. \n\nI know it sounds like he is playing dirty. But it seems he is getting good ROAS from this approach, and, in my opinion, early-stage brands just have to try everything that could work. \n\nHas anyone ever tried something similar before?

      "**Early Adopters**  \nFirst, I always want to be talking to early adopter types. In the context of the technology adoption curve (ref. Crossing the Chasm?), that means:  \n\n\u2022 They must have the *problem* I'm solving  \n\u2022 They must *know* they have the problem  \n\u2022 They must have made a significant *effort* to solve it\n\nThe significant effort you're looking for could be the expenditure of time, money, energy, relationships... How much have they paid (in any form of value) to try to solve this? Maybe they've bought several existing solutions and have been unsatisfied. Maybe they've tried to DIY their own solution.\n\nThese signals show you how much a solution is worth to them. Their attempts at solving the problem reveal the shape and size of the problem, and how a solution needs to fit into their lifestyle or workflows. (ref. Day in the Life experiment method)\n\n**Externally Observable Behaviors (EOBs)**  \nWe usually identify these early adopter types by looking for the evidence of their attempts. Ask yourself what externally observable behaviors do they exhibit? What tracks do they leave for you to follow and find them?\n\n**Prefer Face-to-face**  \nThen we go to where they are. Always strive to encounter them face to face. If you can't meet them in person, a video chat is the next best thing. And then a phone call. See how we're getting less intimate each step we move away from IRL meetings. You lose a lot of nuance with each degree you are removed from the other person. I rarely bother with forms and surveys. They have very limited use in this type of discovery. If low intimacy forms of contact are required to get someone's attention (like a linkedin dm cold message), always push toward the most intimate type available. In your case, you're doing the right thing by trying to get them onto a Zoom call.\n\n**Pre-qualify! Effort = Intent**  \nSo my first answer to your question is this: It's different for every type of product / customer segment. You have _to go where your early adopters are_. If your early adopters are on LinkedIn, that's where you go. Are they? What behaviors identify them as early adopters based on the definition above? If you're running validation tests without pre-qualifying your customers, your results won't represent your actual customer's needs, nor their buying intent. You'll have interviewed people who are not likely to buy, and let them influence your direction. Oops.\n\n**Experiment Design**  \nMy second answer is that it also depends very much on what aspects of your offering and business model you are testing, the nature of your hypothesis, etc. Good experiment design is highly underrated. That's really what you're doing here, and you should take on a very scientific mindset. I don't think I can be more specific as that plays out in so many different ways. But I'll recommend the book Testing Business Ideas by David Bland as one fantastic resources for learning about running startup validation experiments.\n\n**Customer Discovery**  \nLastly, practicing carefully the Customer Discovery methodology explained by Steve Blank, Rob Fitzpatrick, and others is crucial. The quality of insights you'll get from your interviews is only as good as your ability ask excellent questions and really listen to the answers. This is an art and a skill and most people to hone it and leverage it enough. It can truly be a superpower.",

    "selftext": "Recently I came across the news that Omegle was shut down. And as someone who used it previously (not that I was a big fan of it) I started thinking why people would have used it. I recently moved abroad for higher education and as an introvert it has been difficult making friends that are local. As someone who prefers to text and someone working on keeping a conversation going, I realized I needed help with it. I would much rather talk to another real person than an AI chatbot. So I got thinking, maybe a one to one messaging app that connects you with a random person in the same city/ local area every week with the goal of getting to know each other and making friends. The app's primary audience is introverts that struggle to make or keep a conversation going just like me. And to help them the app would feature an AI assistant that would read the last few messages with the other person and suggests follow-ups for the user to type to keep the chat going. The app could also feature a \"third-place finder\" that helps the user find places to meet in-person. The recommendation is based on the messages. Example: if the user says \"would like to have a coffee together and talk more\" and if the other person agrees, a box on the chat window appears showing nearby coffee shops.\n\nHopefully the idea comes across well.

    "selftext": "A friend a few weeks ago approached me about making a webpage in order to make a subscription model for a yoga app \\[not actually yoga but adjacent, I just wanna obfuscate for reasons of anonimity\\] .\n\nMind you my experience with coding is very short (start of year) but relatively deep i.e I have fully custom coded and self deployed on vps 2 sites with docker ( 1 of them being a simple project the other being a django+svelte non transactional auction site the kind where a youtuber could auction some items here and there), and before the exam period started was working on a 3rd that would be an ecommerce site, I am also sporadically helping a friend with a very complex site he is making that's something akin to pc part picker \\[but for a different category\\]. (And that particular friend is the one who got me into coding in the first place, great guy but a lil salty).\n\nAnyways eventually that webapp idea turned into a phone app for ios/android where I have next to no clue and 0 experience, nontheless I am positive I could still make it with enough motivation by end of september or october, but here's the catch.\n\nThing is I am also a very busy chem engineering student for the next year as I have majorly fucked up my uni trajectory and restarted the last year of uni after some muti-year chronic health issues and have to finish till next september.\n\nSo me and my friend and another code-savy non-mutual friend of his had a meeting, the main friend has 90% and he gave 10% to a girl that would take care of the content videos, with my initial proposed sweat equity being 10% which I thought was ultra low even if I'm really practically making jackshit atm (southern europe), so the opportunity cost is slightly less horrific for me. But even then I thought that was super low and countered to 20% but the non-mutual friend said, \"wow hold up that too much, most people only give out 10%, and I would take it for 10% if I wasn't busy with other projects\". So we met halfway at 15%, with me having to make the whole app on android and ios and also take care of maintenance, basically treat it as my own lil newborn. Look I'm the kind of person that come july I could grind this thing daily and obsess about it and maybe have it 90% ready by end of august but the thing is the more I think about it the more a shitty deal it sounds, especially having to deal with maintenance when I'll already be getting a-fucked next semester in uni and I'm envisioning being completely demotivated at spending so much time for this split.\n\nYeah the friend is connected in the scene and he does have physical yoga sites relevant to the service in the subscription app, and would pay the relevant costs of production e.g to get it on playstore or appstore but is that really worth having 5x more equity. Also I said to both of them that I'm gonna get fucked if we capital raise because I'll get diluted but the friend's friend countered with, \"oh that's not gonna come off your percentage, it's gonna stay as is at 15%\". Anyways I got exams right now so I'm busy anyhow but we haven't signed shit and I'm thinking I have to either renegotiate this, and at the very least either get a paid maintanance fee or higher equity, or unlock equity with milestones or sth. I do realise it's kinda rude to walk out now but something happened this week that I quite didn't like which gave me a vibe of getting taken advantage of by this particular friend, which got me rethinking of if I can trust this person to see this through.\n\nLike yeah even if we scale to like 20k monthly recurring revenue (which I guess could realistically happen within a year), my monthly income after taxes and expenses would probably be like 2000 from that app, but that's a good case scenario which would require about 650-700 subscribers. Anyhow I know I wanna grind as much as possible this year and don't wanna pass up the opportunity but I also know I'm very liable to either resent this set of circumstances or burnout due to perceived payment injustice.\n\nHow I perceive it is that he thinks he's throwing me a bone and that perceived lack of experience or competency is what warrants the 15% but an app like this would probably cost minimum 15k just for being production ready without maintenance, so he's probably saving in excess of 15k+ 5k/year on maintenance. Yeah he will incure costs that I won't like marketing but that still pales in comparison. I just am aghast on how to properly evaluate a proper equity split.",

The lead in the 2nd round actually cautioned us not to hire a bunch of people immediately, so I guess this is a common mistake.\n\n\nWe also did a bunch of scenario spreadsheets and came to the conclusion that the only time raising money is really bad is if you spend it badly. And as I later realized, it's very tempting to spend it.\n\n\nSo we stayed small for a while and only hired our 2nd/3rd engineers about a year after we got the second round. We started hiring more aggressively as we got closer to $1m ARR and are up to 15 now. But boy are hiring and management hard.",

What had made everything change was not the tool though, but the habit it created: regular storytelling, quick feedback loops, and a means of measuring post-launch interest.\n\nAfter a few months of tighter focus and faster iterations, the difference in user response was massive.

The best way to engage GP\u2019s during a pitch is to have a conversation like a normal business deal, then if the conversation turns to a specific aspect of the business that needs some explanation, you can use slides OR OTHER MATERIAL as supporting evidence. If it\u2019s a budget, I don\u2019t show a slide, I show a spreadsheet. If it\u2019s milestones I show them the issue system. But most importantly, show them the product."

    "selftext": "I'm looking for some insight from those who\u2019ve built partnerships or joint ventures with much larger companies.\n\nWe\u2019re a newly formed company that came to a major global player in our industry with a product concept aimed at a market they aren\u2019t currently in and there\u2019s real interest in what we\u2019re building. Enough that they have expressed the desire to move forward together in some form.\n\nThe challenge now is figuring out how to formalize the relationship. We\u2019ve already put a lot of time and personal capital into building out these solutions and we believe there's a strong case for a deeper partnership (A joint venture is something we\u2019ve floated) where we bring the innovation and execution on manufacturing, and they bring scale, their name, and market access. That said, they\u2019ve shared that their legal teams aren\u2019t big fans of JV structures but haven\u2019t ruled that path out yet - dependent on what kind of terms we\u2019d propose.\n\nAs a small and relatively new company, we know it\u2019s hard to offer a large corporation the kind of institutional confidence they\u2019re used to. I believe that the a JV could be beneficial to them as well as providing protection for us, but I am open to any relationship that can be mutually beneficial.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* What\u2019s the best way to propose a structure that protects a small company\u2019s interests while still being realistic and appealing to a large partner? (The solution we are offering will be really turn-key for them and solve some problems they have.)\n* Are there approaches other than a formal JV that offer protection and participation but are more likely to get accepted?\n* How do you present value and negotiate from a position of strength when you\u2019re clearly the smaller player?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who\u2019s been through something similar or has insight on how to approach this well.",

      "We saw too many that needed significant improvement, so we ended up offering to review or create them for clients. \n\nHere are only three points, among many, many more of the problems we've encountered over the past five years:\n\n* Formatting - Specifically, a lack of pictures, graphs, or visual diagrams: We often see many decks and business plans that are very dense, meaning wall-to-wall text with no images. As these decks and business plans can sometimes encompass challenging topics or new industries, the reader (investor) may not be well-known to them, yet (For example, they might be very involved in one specific sector and they're branching out to new ones). Pictures, graphs, or visual diagrams can help the reader get a better understanding of the business, industry or product, instead of putting it down and not reading further because they are confused trying to answer - \"so what is it that you actually do?\" (Not an ideal scenario!)\n* Our Team - The number of business plans that do not include any discussion of their team, or fail to elaborate on their own experience (ie. ONLY indicating their title is the CEO of XYC Corp.) This means that they do not showcase any of their (or their team's) experience and fail to demonstrate to the reader that they possess special knowledge or expertise invaluable to the industry. They start to question: Can you be trusted with money? Will this company even make a profit? Some don't even include their company name, personal name, or contact information on any of the documents. \n* Overall Messaging - We are all specialists in our respective fields, and our passion is evident (and infectious!) when we engage in conversation. However, since the deck or business plan often precedes you into the room, sometimes those documents have the opposite effect and can be nothing more than a dry 40-page Master's Thesis on their topic - dense, poorly formatted, and covering topics well beyond what is needed at this stage in the process. This means the deck is confusing and overly elaborate when it doesn't need to be. For a document this extensive, often written only by the founder, it can be difficult to edit on your own, given your level of understanding of the topic. Therefore, 'simple edits' may be missed or only updated on one page, but not on another. While we're accustomed to reading decks and business plans, we want to get an understanding (preferably in 1-2 minutes) of 1) what you do, 2) how you do it, and 3) how much money you need to make this a reality. \n\nThere are many more, but those are some of the major ones.

      "\\>\"How are you able to even get a sit down with a VC or investor to do so?\"  \n  \nUnless you've got connections or some sort of background, getting cold conversations are pretty tricky. There are usually at least 100 other people trying to pound that same person with their pitch.   \n  \nSitting down with VCs and investors is tricky. It's a lot more likely to happen casually if you're in a community they trust. For example, if an investor regularly shows up at events in your local co-working space, being at those events repeatedly and asking insightful questions will usually earn you a chance to briefly chat with them during mixer times. Here's where a lot of folks burn the bridge - when they're standing there, drink in hand, they launch into their pitch. The successful ones don't do that. They make themselves interesting by asking insightful questions about the investor.\n\nThere's always a way - just gotta find it! :)",

Founders do this because they can, and they get much better terms when they do raise.\n\nHow did our startups get pre-revenue investors? Because at the seed round, they are investing in the founders, not the product. They're betting that this team will make magic happen. And they give you just enough money to put a couple proof points on the board before you're back raising your next round. By that point, you do need a product and traction.",

      "Right now everyone's pretty much on high alert about people trying to fake everything by using AI, and once that worry has been raised you can't easily undo it.\n\nThink of it as having a friend around that you trust, but if they just once give you reason to think that they might steal something they can't easily rebuild that trust that originally was the default.\n\nSame here with AI. Once an investor thinks that you've put everything together without understanding it, that you're just using AI to feed the investor the correct lines, they will have a very hard time trusting you again. And there will be no \"discreetly\" about using it.\n\nAnd even if you did get away with it you just won't have that AI when you're meeting that investor in person, or when you're engaging in a conversation even just slightly outside of your own business. Like if they ask you about one of your competitors, or if you're casually talking about the industry. If you've relied on that AI to give the correct answers about your own project your lack of genuine knowledge will pretty quickly reveal itself when talking about anything else.\n\nStudy your own material until you know and understand it, and print it out to have it in front of you if needed, or put it on an iPad, or screen share during the meeting and show them the sections that you're looking up. Odds are that the investors have the same documents open in front of them anyways, since it's part of what you've sent over to even get that meeting.\n\nOr, send them that AI tool along with the documents so that you're all using it in the open. That should work, if you absolutely want to involve AI. But you still need to be able to intelligently discuss your own numbers, as well as intelligently handle the things that you don't know. We can't know everything all the time, and beyond a decent enough base knowledge investors want to see how you handle what you don't know. They don't expect you to be a perfect business machine.\n\nThey are looking to invest in you, in your abilities, not in some designed to look pretty numbers in a spreadsheet.",

The MVP is pretty much done, just missing push notifications and offline mode.\n\nThey've offered me \u20ac20k (not sure if that's before or after taxes) once they hit 300 paying customers. No equity, no virtual stock options. I was kind of hoping for maybe a small percentage through a VSOP to reflect the early stage risk and long-term work I put in, but they shot that down. They want to keep things simple and investor-friendly, and see virtual stock options as too complex or only suited for full-time employees. Plus they don't have cash right now - which I get, I'm not desperate for money either.\n\nHere's the thing though - 300 customers might take a year, might take 5. At that point they'd be making around \u20ac15k monthly, and I get my one-time payment. The mobile app isn't going to have everything the web version does, but it's still a major part of what they're offering.\n\nThey did say they'd help me out if I ever start my own company - share their experience, connections, maybe even some of their code.

Make sure the advisor is performing 2 months and 29 days in and cut him loose if they are not.\n\nIMO, you don't want to grant options at $.001 because then the advisor would almost certainly exercise options whenever they vest because 50,000 is $50 so who cares?  \n\nSo, you might set the GFE of the FMV at a low enough price to represent that you are in conception stage but there is some IP, assets, something.  So I might create a board resolution that says \"Based on our current status of blah blah blah, and our knowledge about blah blah blah, and our IP of blah blah, and our assets of blah blah, we are making a GFE of the enterprise value of ABC Inc to be $250K.\"  Then if you have say 2M fully diluted shares, the GFE would be $0.125.\n\nThen, if you give the advisor 0.5% in options, that would be 10,000 shares.  To exercise those (when fully vested, and ignoring and QSO tax issues), he would have to write a check for $1,250.   It's not a lot, but enough where most people won't write that check if their options are good for 10 years.\n\nMostly, you are trying to give them a reasonable deal but keep them off the SHAREHOLDER ledger and keep them as option holders.\n\nDocument your GFE of your FMV and keep it with your organizational documents.\n\nSource:  I'm the [www.captableexpert.com](http://www.captableexpert.com) (rough version of site currently up).",

Yet after 12+ months of outreach, nothing.\n\nMy theory is geographic limitation. Ukraine's Amazon community is small and doesn't have many people with $50-100k+ to deploy. If I were in US, UK, or Singapore markets, this would probably be solved already.\n\nThis leads to my main question: How is it possible that with such knowledge, experience, and proven past results, I still haven't found an investor after a full year of searching?\n\nIs this a common pattern for experienced operators trying to restart after setbacks? What funding channels am I potentially missing for proven e-commerce models? How important is geographic proximity for early-stage investment relationships?\n\nHonestly, I'm exhausted from this process. The irony is that everyone understands the business model works and my experience is real, but finding that initial capital has been impossibly difficult despite the track record.\n\nAnyone dealt with similar challenges rebuilding after external disruption? Particularly interested in perspectives from founders who've navigated investor relationships across different markets.\n\nP.S. Please don't ask me how I could have lost all my money after earning so much. It went to living expenses, Amazon restocking (hundreds of thousands), lawyers who couldn't get us back to selling, and $100k invested in US stocks that I eventually had to withdraw for living expenses when the money ran out.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a freelance professional offering a mix of services, including animation, graphics, VSL (Video Sales Letters), web development, and more. However, I\u2019ve been stuck in a cycle of targeting lower-paying clients, and I feel like I\u2019m undervaluing my work.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been reading and hearing a lot about high-ticket sales, increasing prices, and selling the value rather than just the service. The problem is, when I look at my current small products (like smaller graphics or basic web design tasks), I just can't wrap my head around how to increase my prices significantly.\n\nEveryone says to raise your rates and focus on selling value, but for me, it feels like a disconnect between what I currently offer and the mindset needed to sell high-ticket services. I'm unsure about how to transition to a higher price point or how to approach clients who are used to paying lower rates.\n\nHas anyone here faced this challenge? How did you bridge the gap between low-ticket and high-ticket clients? What strategies did you use to convey the value of your work and justify a price increase?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!",

      "Here\u2019s what helped me get out of that loop.\n\nFirst, I stopped selling pieces. Instead of saying \u201cI\u2019ll design a logo,\u201d I started saying, \u201cI help early-stage brands look like they\u2019re ready for funding.\u201d That change alone helped people see the *outcome*, not just the work. Clients who want results are more open to spending money.\n\nNext, I bundled services. So instead of one-off animations, I sold a full VSL package with scripting, voiceover, animation, and a landing page. I priced it for the result it created, not the time it took.\n\nAlso, I slowly raised rates with new clients only. That way I wasn\u2019t burning bridges with people who kept me afloat early on. After a while, I stopped accepting small-ticket work altogether.\n\nPositioning is a big part of this. You want your site, pitch, and conversations to sound like you're solving a specific business problem. Not just creating something pretty.\n\nThe big mental shift is realizing you\u2019re not charging *for* the service. You\u2019re charging *for* the difference it makes.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, try picking one offer and turning it into a \u201cvalue ladder.\u201d Start at your best outcome and work backward.

When supply is low (just you) and demand is high (several clients want your services), you can charge whatever you want.   \n  \nI used LinkedIn to create demand - sharing case studies, process, tactics, etc. It took 6 months of posting 2X per week to land my first $6K/ mo client. \n\nBut with this, comes a change in strategy.

      "It's brutally simple: Equity doesn't exist until it one day perhaps does (a couple of years down the line), it's a bonus, not a salary; and without getting a salary you're practically an investor (as you're \"spending\" the money you could be making/banking). So unless you're doing someone a favor you're meant to be making at least a lower end market based salary.\n\nThat's it. You're meant to be compensated enough to have yourself a decent salary while doing the work.\n\nIf you're working with the founder because you believe in their vision you're either doing them a favor, or you do it as an equal cofounder along with them, or they should be paying you a decent enough salary. Anything else is inexperience/stupid.\n\nIf they don't believe enough in their idea to put their house and credit cards and all on the line (to actually pay you), then why are you supposed to believe in their idea to the point where you're sacrificing your money and career working on realizing their dream?",
      "Equity is normally worthless for new companies because a lot of first-time founders hardly end up building something good. So you waste a lot of time + energy. It's borderline gambling. I would suggest getting a flat fee upfront, which could be less than what you normally ask for, and then some equity on top of that.",
      "Before you sign an equity agreement, always make sure you understand the terms and that you've read through company policies on Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements (RSPA). \n\n# You want to make sure you have a clear understanding of the following: \n\n   * Vesting schedule mechanics (e.g., what happens if you stop working mid-week)\n   * Buyback rights if you leave before full vesting\n   * Transfer restrictions or limitations on sale\n   * What happens in the event of an acquisition\n   * Tax obligations or 83(b) election guidance\n\nConsider other options as well, like profit-sharing. This is sometimes a good option for more immediate return. It typically will not give you the same payout as equity would if the company sells for millions down the line, but if you are unsure of your longevity with the company, then that could be worth looking into. I negotiated an agreement recently that starts off as a profit-sharing model and moves into equity if and when I enter into a full-time employment agreement. Right now, I am contracted as a fractional leader. I figure in 6 months, if the company is doing really well and I can see the growth happening, then moving into full-time and negotiating my equity at that time would be a better option and gives me more clarity. \n\nInvesting time and expertise into a startup is a risk that not everyone has the means to take. I don't know if I can give you exact numbers because I'm not an expert in that. But my advice if you are considering moving this direction is to believe in the WHO more than the WHAT.  It's not the creative business model that succeeds, it's the CEO/founder and the team surrounding them that determine whether or not this idea will see the light of day. The nice thing about startups is since they can't offer a high salary or hourly rate right off the bat, you really can work with them to create terms for alternative compensation. And if the company does succeed, you will succeed with them.",

Their technical background is of no interest to company and their connections made to CEO possibly didn\u2019t turn out into anything valuable either. Which is why OP was repeatedly said they are not adding as much value. \n\nSure verbal promises were made but words don\u2019t have any value if it\u2019s not penned down somewhere. \n\nOP went to the board directly and they did seem to bring some points forward to the CEO which is also fine but that\u2019s not the boards job. In an early stage startup, the board will always support the CEO because they have invested in him and his idea. Maybe OP and the CEO didn\u2019t get along and the CEO obviously did not appreciate OP going to board which triggered the animosity. \n\nOP might be in over his head. This is my assumption. \n\nAll in all, OP and CEO were not the right fit. This is uniquely important at an early stage startup that they fit the right fit.\n\nIt\u2019s okay OP, your true potential needs to be unleashed somewhere else. Don\u2019t bother about the past, let\u2019s just move on",
      "That sounds like a seriously rough experience, man.\n\nI read a case study where a toxic founder's behavior was linked to early-stage stress and pressure. It's not an excuse, but it kinda explains how things can spiral out of control. Hope you find a better place soon!",

      "Yeah pre funding startups can be complete chaos lol",
      "Looks like a lot of drama and you've traveled a tough road. A couple things come to mind that's not necessarily specific to your situation, but just the reality of the startup world.\n\n1. The stakes are very different at a startup compared to an established company. If you start working for a startup, don't go in thinking you can treat it like a j-o-b, or that good intentions are enough. As frustrating as it can be, doing things outside of your comfort zone is comoletely normal. The employee mindset, where you expect someone to tell you exactly what you need to do or working hard, is rarely sufficient. The dynamic evolves depending on the funding situation and company maturity.\n\n2. If the funding is minimal (e.g., from the founder\u2019s personal bank account), non-founders can still get equity compensation if their past, present, or future value is material. If the value isn't material, or the person is a passive participant, then equity comp is likely off the table. Otherwise, there could be cases where equity is off the table because its already distributed thin. \n\n3. Your technical and interpersonal skills will be tested at a startup because there are fewer people and resources available to leverage. You have to fill in the gaps. The reality is that the startup machine is on a constant path to failure, and its not going to wait for its employees to get tasking that they are comfortable with. Everyone must take ownership and risk. Consequently anyone who gets paid in equity or money must earn their share.\n\n4. Board members, who might be equity compensated, are interesting because they may take on a less active role in the company\u2019s execution. Their value is primarily in the expertise, advice, and wisdom brought to the startup. Usually these board members make up an advisory board that has less power over the company than a board of directors. Sometimes, if not many times, the execution of the startup will conflict. The CEO has to make judgements accordingly.\n\nNot sure if this shapes perspective at all. In any case, learn from your experiences and let them shape how you take on your next adventure.",

The \u201cboard members\u201d are vain idiots who want imagined status that goes along with the title.\u00a0\n\nTake the positives of the lessons you have learned here and move on. There\u2019s nothing more for you with these people.\u00a0\n\nVeteran worker life advice: save your passion for things that idiots can\u2019t easily take away from you. Life is too short to give your passion away to people who don\u2019t care about you.\u00a0",
      "Working without a contract is startup suicide. Verbal promises mean absolutely nothing when things go sideways and founders show their true colors. Always get equity and compensation in writing before doing any real work.",

      "Huh? Your role became \u201cpitching\u201d? Pitching what? Do you mean it became sales? Your company had no employment agreements but it had board members with power? \n\nThis story is very odd.",
      "It's like many other pre-funding startups who are too cheap to hire a lawyer to formalize the company. The founder is mostly to blame since they are not sticking to their commitments. But you can't entirely say \"it's not you\" because you chose to join and work under those conditions. I understand it got worse but you accepted the risk at the start and chose to trust the founder, that is on you.\n\nIf the startup has funding/assets, you can sue based on what you described. There is a promise of equity and that is potentially enforceable. I represents startups and founders, if there is something worth fighting over, it is worth fighting. The founder likely did a lot of wrongs in governance, so shouldn't be too difficult of a case.\n\nBut the moral should be if a startup is not willing to pay a few thousand dollars to get everyone's agreement done. they probably won't be successful because they don't understand risks, governance, and growth.",
      "if your startup is in california, companies can't legally pay someone below minimum wage so if you've tracked your hours, then you should have legal recourse if startup takes off.",
      "You obviously contributed Intellectual Property that you are still the owner of unless you formally assigned it to the company. This means you will likely win in court should you sue for an ownership stake. If specific compensation was ever discussed it will likely be awarded to you even if nothing was formally signed."

    "title": "Is B2B SaaS playbook outdated for AI startup? I will not promote.",
    "selftext": "\ud83d\udd25Hot take : SaaS playbook is not relevant to AI startup. i will not promote.\n\nWhy? \n\n1- Revenue is not margin. \nTraditionnal SaaS has very low marginal cost per new user. AI cost is much higher. \n\n2- Adoption rate. \nA lot of people are ready to try new tools. B2C beats B2B. \n\n3- No more software moat. \nAny feature or integration can be replicated in days. \n\n4- No more problem bound. \nSaaS are narrow specialized software that solve 1 problem. AI is about solving a workflow for a type of user.\n\nSo what is your new playbook?",
    "comments": [
      "I've been seeing a lot of AI startups in the valley and I think this is absolute bullshit in the current ecosystem outside of VC hype.\n\nMost AI startups are basically SaaS tools except with lower margin due to compute cost at the moment. A lot of it is just skinner boxes based off the current big models, and those doing more model development or video are bleeding VC money on compute costs.\n\nThere is definitely the long term promise with more agent stuff but its currently not really good enough to be useful widespread across multiple industries. I've seen a lot of VC backed AI startups in the valley late last year that raised but their current models weren't good enough so they are actually doing the services for their customers manually with the promise that their tech is going to work eventually.",
      "You\u2019re not wrong, but the take needs refining.\n\n1. Marginal cost: True, inference isn\u2019t free. But it\u2019s also not static. With model distillation + usage gating (e.g., tiered limits), you can still run margin-positive. It\u2019s not SaaS level, but it\u2019s not doomed either.\n2. Adoption: Yes, B2C growth is tempting, but monetizing B2C AI is a knife fight. CAC isn\u2019t just paid ads, it\u2019s UX, retention loops, and onboarding UX that\u2019s 10x tighter than B2B. Most B2C AI apps hit novelty walls fast.\n3. Moat: Agreed, no feature moat. But there\u2019s still a compound moat if you own distribution, usage data, or vertical-specific workflows (e.g., regulatory edge in healthcare AI or proprietary fine-tuning for legal).\n4. Problem vs. workflow: Spot on. The winners won\u2019t just solve a task, they\u2019ll own the whole outcome loop. That\u2019s the real evolution.\n\nSo the playbook isn\u2019t dead, it\u2019s just heavier on distribution, UX velocity, and vertical integration. If anything, it\u2019s \u201cAI-native GTM > SaaS GTM.\u201d Still has echoes of SaaS, but built for a different stack and sales motion.",
      "B2C might have faster adoption but B2B still pays way better. Consumer AI tools are racing to the bottom on pricing while enterprise customers will drop serious money for workflow automation that actually works consistently.",
      "I agree with the premise.\n\nBy normal SaaS playbook you probably mean, own a niche and expand once it is possible, right?\n\nA few thoughts -   \n  \n1) If you build & train your own models, you won't have issues with massive LLM costs. At least if you're smart about it.   \n2) Adoption is easy on the user level, but hard to get middle-management involved. We have gotten used to rewarding middle management for the number of people they manage, not the number of bots or the efficiencies they created. Hence I don't think they are incentivised to adopt AI in any way (especially in big orgs.) -> so I think better AI adoption  aka. companies actually start paying for it, once the incentive problem is solved in more companies.   \n3. I think the MOAT part is the big issue. There will be an explosion of SaaS (just read AI2027), they all look the same to the consumer and everyone will try to ponder to tinier niches to get some traction. \n\n  \nTo be honest, I try to get more knowledgeable about unscalable/hard to measure things like a) Communities b) micro-events c) Branding d) positioning -> if you can own/build a community THAT is a MOAT. (think clay)",
      "Yo, interesting points!\n\nI see where you're coming from with the higher costs and faster replication in the AI space. We're finding that hyper-personalization in lead gen and content is key for AI SaaS cos to stand out from the noise and show real value, especially 'cause adoption needs a lil' extra push.",

So many Saas are consulting in disguised but priced as a McDonald meal this is not serious and has never been a sustainable business in the first place. I won\u2019t be long here but just look at the end of the day who has been winning money in this area before AI and it was cloud providers and ad marketplaces so\u2026 \n\nAI for B2B is an opportunity for builders to make their customers aware of the actual price so in a way the change is positive. \n\nTo say it differently, saas were able to compete with internal it teams because their prices and delivery speed could not be matched. If they priced correctly they would not have been so competitive.",

I don't like to talk about it. Talk is cheap. I have invested half of my life learning to make complicated worlds kind of work, and now I have to come back to plain English? Imagine you had learned to drive a spaceship and now you are back sitting in this old car, pressing the clutch and changing gears.\n\nBut still, writing code is an act of communication as much as writing is. Many fellow coders don't treat it like that, but they should. Coders compose worlds. Coding is about communicating with other coders or your future self. The way you express your program is a combination of experience, ideas, and opinions on how to structure processes and flows. There are countless opportunities and decisions on how you would express and solve the task at hand. Coders can and should be considered writers.\n\nThat's why I expect myself to be able to communicate my thoughts clearly in prose. If I can't do it in plain English, how can I expect myself to do it in code? In a way, these two go hand in hand. If writing is walking in the park, coding is riding a broken bicycle while drunk. So what am I? I am in the business of communicating ideas, constructing worlds, understanding workflows, and ultimately understanding my potential users, other people. Because not only am I a coder, I also sell a product. Other humans will use it. Both development and promotion are a unified process of throwing what once was in my head back into the world.\n\nAs a coder, I consider writing and promoting my product a chore. Something that doesn't suit my personality and the way my brain works. But as I dive deeper into it, I realize that maybe I am wrong. Maybe writing and expressing myself in English is exactly what I need. Deconstructing my vision and trying to get it across is like doing psychotherapy in public. I will certainly not be going to share my darkest thoughts, but I am going to be part of this evolutionary exchange of ideas and feelings.\n\nSo yeah, I am a full-time writer. I just don't accept it yet.\n\nWhat about you people? Where do you find yourselves between writing/promoting and coding? Do you enjoy it?",

    "selftext": "We have found a strategy that works with all of our customers we create joint slack channels (aside from the Teams user). We have 20+ now customer external connect channels and need to introduce a proper ticketing and system to announce changes in. Ticketing and support is the number one feature request but the second is to alert them all of lets say an outage or a new system launch. The companies I've found and am working to see who should be the top two to actually run POC's with:\n\n* wrangle.io\n*  usepylon.com\n*  suptask.com\n* clearfeed.ai\n\nCan anyone recommend any of them or give any feedback that may help, we really are hitting a wall with customer service and we do it all via slack mostly and its time to use one of the slack based tcketing systems. Our entire team is opposed to doing a zendesk/freshdesk type roll out we just want it to be modern, work well in slack, and have basic capabilities of a support system. We are not a 24/7 critical business.",
    "comments": [
      "We\u2019ve tested a few, Clearfeed and Suptask are the most mature for Slack native workflows. Clearfeed has better auto triage and AI features if you're scaling fast; Suptask is simpler, great if your team just wants structure without overhead.\n\nAvoid traditional help desks, they kill velocity in Slack native teams. POC both, but lean toward whichever matches your async style + alerting needs. Wrangle\u2019s better for workflows than tickets, and Pylon feels early stage.",
      "We\u2019re in the same boat: Slack-first, no interest in bloated legacy tools, Clearfeed and Suptask feel the most native and responsive; Clearfeed especially shines with AI-powered triage and updates across channels.",

    "selftext": "Hello! I launched a B2C last month and recently added a feature that actually makes it a two sided marketplace.\n\nBeen hitting up all the socials and doing outreach where my ICPs hang out.  I\u2019ve got close to 100 users now and just 4 have paid.  \n\nThings seem to be slowing down, so what now? Keep on hitting up the socials but worried I might be met with resistance and marked as a spammer.  \n\nDo I go to paid ads?  Do I offer monetary incentives? \n\nThanks in advance",
    "comments": [
      "Before jumping to ads or incentives, it might help to slow down and listen. Reach out directly to the users who *haven\u2019t* paid and ask why. Keep it short and honest - something like \u201cI\u2019d love to understand what\u2019s missing or holding you back from upgrading.\u201d That feedback can shape your next move way better than guessing.\n\nAlso, see if your paying users are getting real value. If they are, ask if they\u2019d refer someone. One strong referral is worth more than 100 cold posts on social.\n\nPaid ads can work, but only if your landing and offer are tight. Otherwise, it\u2019s just burning money. Same with incentives - they only help if they bring in users who\u2019ll actually stick around.",
      "Hey, I\u2019m in a very similar boat with my own B2C marketplace platform\u2014launched recently, doing lots of organic outreach and running some Google Ads ($5/day, getting clicks and about 200 total site visits but no sales yet). I am also concerned about spamming socials and getting blocked everywhere.\nI\u2019m also wondering about timing for trying influencer marketing or increasing ad spend\u2014should we keep pushing, or pause and refine? Curious to hear what the experts here recommend.",
      "Been there. Early growth always feels like shouting into the void. Instead of more outreach, try making your first few users obsessed.....turn them into advocates. A tiny loyal base talks louder than ads ever will",
      "congrats on getting your first users! at this stage, i\u2019d experiment with:\n\n* customer interviews to understand why most don\u2019t convert.\n* referral incentives for current users.\n* focused paid ads targeting precise audiences on platforms where your users hang out.\n* content marketing around your product\u2019s unique value.\n\nwhat channels have you found most effective so far?",

      "Congrats on the launch and the new marketplace feature! Hitting 100 users in a month is solid. 4 paying is the challenge. Before scaling with paid ads or incentives, let's dive deeper:\n\n1. **Talk to those 4 paying users!** What made them convert? Their feedback is gold.\n2. **Why aren't the other 96 paying?** Survey or interview them. Are they not seeing the value? Is there a usability issue? Pricing? Onboarding?\n3. **Refine your ICP.** Maybe you're targeting the wrong people.\n4. **Consider a free trial or freemium model.** Let users experience the full value before paying.\n5. **Content marketing!** Instead of just \"hitting up\" socials, create valuable content that addresses their pain points and subtly highlights your marketplace.\n6. **Don't abandon organic outreach, but be smarter about it.** Focus on building relationships and providing value first.\n\nPaid ads and incentives *could* work, but only *after* you understand why people aren't currently paying. Fix the core value proposition first.",
      "I\u2019m a big fan of influencer marketing. If it\u2019s a recurring subscription product, you can offer them a substantial profit share instead of paying them. Depends on who your target market is, but I\u2019m personally a big fan of this approach",
      "What are u selling",
      "On the one hand, you can say that your conversion is not bad, but on the other hand, to answer your question, you need to understand what you are doing, why, how and for whom. Perhaps by slightly changing the strategy or messages for users, your sales will soar. Or perhaps by investing more money in advertising, you will lose it all due to inconsistency with the market, buyer, etc. Without initial data, I would start from the beginning, from vision, value, etc.",
      "Post content that showcases features. You can do it without being salesly",
      "I guess its worth to get in touch users who haven't paid yet and see what would make them pay for it. Sometimes you could design an add-on service offer to add value to what you already have based on their feedback. Also create content targeting the problems you seek to solve. No need to be that deep on social media, just take a moment in the week to talk about the problem and why that matters (and add in at the end how you solve it, check hubspot and shopfy content on youtube and on their blogs, they are a great example on how to do it). Since you already know where you ICP hang out online, check the what they talk about and use it as a foundation for your content creation too",

      "Yo g, it looks like you need some leads. Check out $100M Leads by Alex Hormozi. The book is a goldmine to build a lead generating machine. It will definitely help you out.",
      "Maybe try IG ads - I've been seeing more and more Saas ads there lately",
      "If 96 out of 100 aren\u2019t paying, they\u2019re either confused about what your platform does, or they don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth acting on yet.\n\nA song fixes both. It explains your value in a way that makes it feel clear, urgent, and worth it without you needing to repeat yourself. You pin it in your Reddit outreach or send it in DMs so people hear the reason to try it before brushing it off. It\u2019s direct, short, and repeats the exact reason to sign up.\n\nDo you want one that gets people to take your offer seriously the first time they see it?",
      "Sounds like you're in the process of vetting the business model and whether people are willing to pay for it. If it's not \"ready\" yet, you're right, hitting the socials hard probably won't change much. I'd think about content that doesn't \"sell\" but that starts to establish you as the thought leader/disruptor in your space.",
      "If you have the money to run ads, I would go that route.\n\nJust be sure to be very careful about your Cost Per Acquisition. Generally as long as CPA is less than a single month (assuming subscription SaaS you would be good). \n\nA \u201cfree\u201d option would be to try to introduce mechanisms for network effects. You have 100 users so doing some incentive based referral program could help widen the net a bit more also. Still 100 is not that many, but a program like this is helpful if you\u2019re building more traction with ads."

Figma is selling a webapp for UI/UX design, with live synchronization, permission management, and like, a nice layout editor.\n\nBut what are customers buying?\n\n- The ability for managers to make slight changes\n- the ability to not have to share fucking files around to see an updated design\n- no _final_final_final.psd in the shared drive\n- an easy way to comment/collaborate\n- not having to write an email where you go \"for the button in the top right that says \"Hello\", can you change the font to...?\"\n- and a more effective use of the designer's time,\n\nIn short, people are buying\n\n- an effective way to build designs for big applications\n- that's build for collaboration\n\nWhat people are buying is being (emotionally) free from problems - what you're selling is the technical solution to it.\n\nIf you're Discord, you're selling:\n\n- a platform where they can upload chat with friends\n- create servers\n- be in voice calls\n- share small files and pictures\n- and organize stuff into channels.\n- With a mobile client and a desktop client\n- And working notifications\n\nBut the customers are *buying* \n\n- access to their communities and friends\n- the ability to talk to their friends\n- wherever they are: on their phone *and* the desktop\n- via text *and* voice\n- privately *and* in groups\n\nThose are things which is an emotional need they met, that wasn't  somehting WhatsApp / Facebook / TeamSpeak / Skype / ... supported well at the time. WhatsApp had a shitty desktop story, Facebook didn't really do voice, neither of them did groups with seperate channels. TeamSpeak had no offline messages, no way of asynchronous communication, and no good mobile story.\n\nThey're buying the warm fuzzy feeling that you get when you hang with your friends on the couch, or send them a quick text, and you're never really disconnected or alone.\n\nIt's such a big difference in how you think about your product and sales, and it's a good thing to think about each time.",

      "When we hear projects pitched to us (we work on the private funding side), we ask for two things. Can you explain what your project is about in 1-2 sentences, and once you've pitched, and I can't stress it enough, stop pitching.\n\nTime for some elaboration on those two points. \n\n**The 1-2 sentence pitch**\n\nWhen you are going to pitch a project to a funding source of any kind, keep in mind that your documents might precede you into the room. The funding source will have already read your pitch deck and/or business plan first, so a lot of the heavy lifting has already been done in terms of explaining what your project is about. When you meet the funding source, or a representative for them, or a company like ours that helps with those introductions, a soft pitch has already been done to get that interest. The funding source, and even our company, will read the docs and then ask, \"So can you tell me about your project?\" My COO goes so far as to ask, \"Can you tell me about your project in 1-2 sentences?\" If you can't pitch in those two sentences, you've most likely gone too far. If you feel that you need more than two sentences to explain what the project is about, challenge yourself to put it into 1-2 sentences. It's also great practice, in case you end up in an impromptu meeting with someone important, you can pitch right there and then easily.\n\n**Stop pitching after the pitch**\n\nThe number of meetings we've had where a company will give their pitch (We're lucky if it's the 1-2 sentences), but even when we told them we understood the pitch, they keep pitching, and pitching, and pitching some more. Throughout the meeting, which lasts anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour or more, it's a constant pitch. If you're a project owner, founder, or similar, and you feel the need to keep pitching beyond those 1-2 sentences, you look desperate, and you're not taking stock of the fact that the most important people in the room are the ones who will be giving you money. The golden rule in business is \"he who has the gold makes the rules,\" and that either is not known or is forgotten every step of the way. Project owners who believe their project is the best in the world and that people giving money should fall at their feet need to give their head a shake. That project can easily be dismissed for another similar project the next day, especially if the other project owner is easier to work with. Pitch once, listen, ask questions, stop pitching, listen more, ask another question, listen again. The funding sources will ask you questions about your project, what they feel is essential to give you money, not what you might think is essential to get money.\n\nIt might feel long-winded, but those two paragraphs are to drive home a point that is often missed in the pitching process - spend more time listening, and when necessary, respond to the questions as succinctly as possible. If you struggle to stop yourself from talking or pitching, put yourself on mute when you are not talking - it's a small trick that works well for me, too!",

    "selftext": "I got an intro with a well known VC last week. The meeting generally went well, but I can\u2019t determine if they were just being nice or actually think my idea has potential. \n\nThe meeting was scheduled for 30 minutes and they gave me an hour. The TLDR of it was that they think I need to find a technical co-founder and also try to build a scrappy v1 once I do. I\u2019m not technical, more growth/GTM and clinical operations. \n\nThey actually connected me with a technical founder that they backed in the past that lives near me. I agreed to get coffee with the guy, but didn\u2019t get a ton of other context. Not sure if they\u2019re saying this guy would be a good co-founder or if maybe he can possibly help me find someone locally to work with. \n\nAny way, I followed up right after the meeting thanking them for the connection and for the time. They followed up right away, making it sound like they\u2019re excited to reconnect in a few weeks, although nothing hard set in stone.\n\nThis is my first interaction with a VC other than via email. Can anyone help me interpret how this meeting actually went?\n\nI\u2019m at the point where I need to decide if I just stop now or if I actually try to find a co-founder and build this. I have 2 kids under 2 and work full time, so working on this will likely cut into one of those two things. I know the company is a good idea and if I don\u2019t start it someone else will- I just also don\u2019t want to look back in a few weeks and have lost my full time job because this is detracting my focus.

      "I'd say generally when a profit oriented entity, such as a VC firm spends time (1 hour meeting) and social capital (introducing you to someone with a solid track record) on you, it's strong signal that they want you to work on this.\n\nWhether that will translate to any offers will probably depend on the MVP, but the ball's definitely in your court.",
      "Founder here\u2026 background: I\u2019ve raised 5 rounds of VC ($180M in venture raised)\u2026\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have a co-founder and line of site to an early team it will be extremely difficult for you to fundraise \n\n2. There are pre-seed firms that will introduce you to potential co-founders and founding engineers, but all they will do is make the initial intro, it\u2019s on you to decide if you want to cofound together \n\n3. Assume you find that cofounder and 1-3 early engineers willing to quit their jobs and join you, raising your seed round will take 50-100 meetings with 20+ firms. This will be a 90-120 day process and at the end maybe 1-2 give you term sheets. \n\n4. The only way to really shortcut #3 is if you\u2019re a second-time founder with a team ready to go and existing VCs that have already made money off you \n\n5. At the early stages, your idea doesn\u2019t actually matter, your early team is the true differentiator. A key discussion during investment committee (the partners at the VC firm that must vote and agree to fund you) is if you can attract talent. If you cannot, how will you scale the company? If using contractors or offshore resources is the answer you\u2019ll likely get passed on because there\u2019s no team\n\nMy two cents: invest time networking and find that early team, or at least get integrated into communities you can recruit that team from. Until then don\u2019t do anything more than casual meet and greets with VC\u2019s. If you pitch them with no team, you\u2019ll struggle to get their attention when you\u2019re ready to raise\n\nOnce you take a VC check the 18-24 month clock starts. That\u2019s all you have for runway and if you don\u2019t hit the next set of metrics you\u2019re out of business  \n\nFinally\u2026 starting a company is a family decision. I had 2 small kids when I started Horizon3. For 4 years I barely saw them. Barely took a vacation. Worked nights and weekends. Had no predictable schedule. I was unreliable for kid pickup and dropoff. Be mentally prepared for work stress to be the primary driver for home stress",
      "The game theory for VCs is keep as many startups in the pipeline as possible. Then they can boost their numbers for LPs. For example: \u201cwe screened 10,000 startups this year and chose the top 5\u201d sounds good to an LP. A VC seeming\u00a0enthusiastic does not mean much, move on and don\u2019t look back.",
      "Been a founder several times. Your meeting went well with the VC. They liked you, or the person who introed you, or both of you. But don\u2019t look too much into it. Even getting an investment from a VC fund is just your \u201cwelcome to the poker table\u201d chips. It isn\u2019t personal or founder validation. \n\nYour next step is to decide if you want a cofounder and if the guy you are being introduced to you is the right fit, personally, professionally, technically, this is a marriage, not just a cofounding. \n\nYou decided to be the CEO of a company and a founder. It is your job to decide how to allocate resources, time, capital, human, in order to achieve the appropriate benchmarks. Especially today with AI there are a lot of solo founders building companies/MVPs. \n\nFinally, as a general rule, someone with young children does not make a good founder. But it can work. My cofounder currently also has two children under 2 and a full time job, so trust me I\u2019m speaking from experience here. I would tell you that you absolutely need a good cofounder if you have young kids. But you need to have a discussion with your family about how you will make a notoriously chaotic and emotionally draining experience such as starting a company work for you. \n\nLastly, someone else commented about VC investment and needing to show you can hire talent. The role of a founder is to gather resources: employees, capital, advisors, board members, and CUSTOMERS. Being a solo founder is a giant red flag in the sense it really brings up the question of can you gather resources? The more resources you gather the more you derisk the red flag. If you have customers lining up to buy your product then you have derisked a lot of the business. If you can convince a major VC to invest preproduct or MVP you derisk when it comes to hiring technical people, so on and so forth. But don\u2019t expect people to join your company, share your vision, and help you build what you want to, if you can\u2019t be a good leader and gather resources.",

      "\"liked my idea\" is the wrong framework and will hinder your progress.  \n  \nHow do you expect your investors to recover their money? How does this compare with safer options the consensus being Treasury Bills are the safest (close to 5% interest per year) and your risk of failing to build a company, sell and make any money being higher than the riskiest stock because a listed company at least has staff, balances, assets, ...? \n\nRemember investors often have a fiduciary duty and need to prove they followed established practices to protect the money trusted to them e.g. orthodox valuation frameworks like the one taught by Damodaran at NYU (Corporate Finance) or Andy Lo at MIT you can watch for  free on youtube.",
      "Of those 'never existed before' ideas actually revealed, none stood up to a minute on a search engine. Now you know the real reason people don't reveal ideas here.",
      "It's rare for a big VC to be \"nice\" in that way. When they're on the clock, so to speak, they simply can't give away their time like that - too many people demanding their attention and too much money at stake to spend even 30 minutes being nice. Personally they might be quite pleasant and generous, but professionally they're virtually not allowed to be even if they'd like to take the time to deep dive with every founder they meet.\n\nIf they're going over time that's a good sign. Spending extra time with you likely meant they were spending less with someone else, which is a huge professional no-no without a damn good reason, or giving you their personal time, which their family might not appreciate without a good reason.\n\nThat said, just because a VC thinks the idea has potential doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea to build it. The time and financial commitment is enormous, and statistically most startups fail even if the idea is great. Remember that VCs are absolutely killing it if 10% of the companies they fund go big. Those 90% that didn't were ideas with potential as well, else the VC wouldn't have funded them. With a young family, you may not be in a position to take on that level of commitment and risk.",
      "They think you *might* have something but aren\u2019t sure about you, so they wanted to connect you with someone who could maybe help, or more likely, just give them more feedback. All of this is still positive. The question is who is responding - is it a partner or someone lower level? Getting the follow up and who is on the meeting will tell you how interested they really are.",
      "This sounds like a positive early interaction. VCs can be a little cutthroat sometimes, and these guys are being pretty generous with their time and intros. The way I read it is that they\u2019re saying \u201cwe like what you\u2019re building, but we need to see a technical co-founder first before getting involved.\u201d Expecting a technical co-founder isn\u2019t unusual especially if the product is SaaS or something STEM related. So it\u2019s not a \u201cno\u201d but more like \u201cnot yet, but we\u2019re leaving the door open.\u201d",
      "In my experience VCs don\u2019t like to go out of their way to be nice and waste their limited time. They tend to be direct if not a bit harsh, which results in better feedback to the entrepreneur.",
      "Typically, you should look down at your hands. Do you see a term sheet?",
      "If a VC is making intros they like you, however the biggest signal they want to invest is if they are pitching their firm to you and insisting why they would be the best partner.\n\nWhen they start pitching to you then you know.",
      "It's simple:\n\nA) they're pestering you wanting to invest - they like your idea;\n\nB) they want to stay in touch - they don't loke your idea\n\n\"Stay in touch\" is being friendzoned by the VC. Can still be useful, add them to your newsletter with regular updates from your startup (you do have that, right.... right?) They may become fans just in time for your next round. But zero chance of them wanting in on the action *now*.",
      "Short answer: You know by if they've given you any money yet.\n\nSlightly longer answer: It's all by experience, so try to attach some sort of experienced mentor or angel investor to your project, because they'll fairly easily be able to tell you how to deal with the investors that you're currently talking to. And that'll save you from wasting a lot of time on duds.\n\nGot network with your local community (meetup.com is usually where to start looking for local events) to try to get yourself a network that's actually dealt with these same investors. That'll help a lot.",
      "VCs in general are not nice. They value their time immensely. For them to give an additional of your time should mean something. As for the co-founder, not to sure but it\u2019s someone who they trust.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important is do you trust them?",
      "The technical founder you met also provided feedback to the VC firm. It was a bit of due diligence.",

You need to find what fits you better, and that can scale with the business with low maintenance.\n\nIf you want to connect and talk over LinkedIn, let me know on DM!",

Everything came to a grinding halt for them while they tried to find my replacement. The guy who replaced me was far from ideal because everyone was in a rush to get things moving again. This resulted in a reduced runway, and my cofounder chose to take a paycut to make up the difference.\n\nI quit and found a comfortable job, while my ex-cofounder dropped down to a minimum wage salary and moved into a 1-room apartment with three other team members. I took 0% equity and didn't even ask for my money back because I'm a decent human being.\n\nYour ex-cofounder is greedy. He's creating a mess that you'll need to clean up after he's gone, and thinks you should be grateful. Parting on good terms is impossible -- the problem isn't you, it's him. He feels entitled to equity, despite not being willing to work for it.\n\nI agree with everyone saying to fire him ASAP and give 0%. You're screwed either way.",

That\u2019s the whole point of a vesting period. You need to do the minimum amount of work to even qualify, and you have a contract to ensure this exact situation doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have an agreement, and it\u2019s all verbal or handshake, then you can do what you want, but I\u2019d still say 0%.

And he could wait 1 month for the first year to vest. Once it\u2019s vested I doubt you can take it back even for cause..outside of anything but fraud. Maybe your docs are written in a more unique way - or I misunderstood your post.\n\nSo point being I agree with you he deserves nothing or very little\u2026but I\u2019m not sure what you can take or do - you could fire him for cause before the month is up so he has nothing vested - but that is a bad fact pattern to a judge.",

      "While I haven't dealt a lot with tech hiring, I've done my fair share of interviews for startups in a remote set up and this is one of the most common issues I've come across too, so figured I'll give my 2 cents on some of the questions you asked -\n\n1. I've had a lot of candidates misrepresent their skills/experience, even their previous jobs or pay. Most times, I'm able to catch on during my first interview with them, as I tend to go pretty deep in their background and focus a lot on their overall body language or tone of speaking. If you've been doing it for long enough, it's easy to tell when someone is just throwing around buzzwords that they think I want to hear, as compared to someone who knows what they're talking about.\n\n3. This is controversial, but I do, for the most part, trust good resumes even if they seem AI-generated unless they have an obvious error. I'd rather reject someone after interviewing if I'm not convinced, rather than forego a potentially good candidate just because their CV looked too good to be true.\n\n6. A little biased as I do have a recruiting startup myself but companies generally are very open to such a model where they can access pre-vetted candidates. I believe the pricing we offer is pretty decent as compared to close/far competitors (in US) and we've never had someone say they like us but we're too costly.\n\nIf your client is a startup, or a founder who doesn't have a TA team - they'd probably say yes 9/10 times to use such a service (given the price seems fair) as compared to combing through job boards or assessing candidates for a role they might not be the expert in.",
      "The solution to AI BS is not more AI BS.",
      "We encounter misrepresentation a lot, and it's only getting more frequent with AI. Most of the time, it's pretty easy to filter out during a technical interview (not a coding exercise) where we just talk shop for half an hour, but occasionally a bad hire slips through and it can get costly.\n\nRealistically, I feel like you don't *really* know if a hire was a good decision until around 3 months in. You can get a strong suspicion within the first few weeks, but until that 3 month mark it's hard to know for sure.\n\nAnd 3 months of a bad hire generally costs us between $40-$60k if you include time costs and salary costs (estimated, obviously).\n\n>How appealing would it be if candidates were pre-vetted using a mix of AI tools and trusted experienced developers before they got to you?\n\nI've had recruitment agencies and productive software companies pitch something like this before, and the problem is that \"trusted experienced developers\" is context dependent here. Even if someone is generally a good developer, I don't trust them to make a determination of whether or not a candidate would be a good fit *for this position* unless they know me, my company, and we have similar alignment on what makes a developer a good fit. If a recruitment agency just hires some random contract developers to vet candidates, I wouldn't describe that as having a \"trusted experienced developer\" vet them (but the recruiter would).\n\nUltimately, if we're going to hire a recruiter (or pay for a software/platform that provides these candidates), we're looking for something to provide us candidates that succeed beyond the 3-month mark. Whatever tools you use to achieve that result (pre-vetting, AI tools, experienced developers, etc) is somewhat irrelevant to me - what matters to me is the result (i.e. whether or not the candidates you're presenting actually end up being successful).\n\n>Would you trust candidates more if they could prove they had real access to a project's live site - like showing a simple, technical way to confirm they actually worked on it?\n\nNot particularly. The metric we care about isn't \"did you actually work on this project\" - it's \"did you know what you were doing on that project? do you know how to maintain it? are you good at maintaining it? are you efficient at building it? how much of this was other people? can you do equally as good a job without those other people? etc\"\n\n>Would you pay to access verified, reviewed, hire-ready candidates? If so, how much feels fair (per hire or per month)?\n\nWe've had so many lackluster experiences at this point that our general stance is \"if we want it done right we have to do it ourselves\" OR \"we're willing to take a chance IF payment is contingent AND the recruiter/platform is reasonably skilled/trustworthy\"\n\nOn a strictly contingent contract where we have 3 months to make a keep/fire decision and includes a clawback if they leave before a year? Easily worth 20-30k. Beyond that price point it depends.\n\n>How does this compare to services you already use (LinkedIn, job boards, ATS, etc.)?\n\nInitial vetting isn't the bottleneck in our hiring process, so it doesn't really move the needle unless it's doing something that those other services aren't (i.e. providing truly hire-ready candidates).",

      "This is exactly the pain point we're tackling at Promap - the screening process for remote hiring is broken and getting worse with AI-generated everything.\n\nTo your questions:\n\n1. Way more than I'd like to admit. Maybe 30-40% of candidates misrepresent something significant \n\n2. The time cost is brutal - probably 8-12 hours of collective team time for a bad hire that doesn't work out in the first few weeks. Money wise, if you factor in onboarding, training, lost productivity... easily $10-15k\n\n3. Not really anymore. Portfolios especially - too easy to fake or exaggerate contributions. I've started asking very specific technical questions about projects they claim to have worked on\n\n4. This is basically what we're building - the key is having actual experienced devs do the vetting, not just AI flagging keywords\n\n5. Yes! Proving actual access to live projects would be huge. Most people can't fake that level of technical verification\n\n6. For truly vetted talent? Probably $500-1000 per successful hire feels reasonable vs the current cost of bad hires\n\nThe in-person nuance thing you mentioned is real. Remote hiring definitely loses those subtle cues you get from face-to-face interactions.\n\nOne thing that's helped us: doing short paid trial projects (1-2 days) instead of just relying on interviews. Shows you exactly how someone works and communicates in a distributed setup.\n\nWhat's your current hiring volume like? Might have some specific suggestions based on scale.",
      "My last two places were at the size that I had an in-house recruiter that I could work directly with. I just about doubled my last org over 2 years with really great staff, and the place before that I started with an intern and hired the org up to around 40 people by the time I moved on. \n\nHere's what's worked for me: \n\n1. **Recruiter with experience:** My recruiter partners had experience hiring technical people in those particular areas. Really hard to filter and find if you don't know how to read what you're seeing.\n\n2. **Be simple but clear in your candidate profile:** if you can't describe explicitly what this person will be doing for the next year, go back and reassess why you're hiring and what for. Once you know, clearly, what they'll do, explain that as simply as you can in a listing, and give your recruiter detailed \"must have\" and \"nice to have\" technologies, skills, experience to search with. If someone's going to work on payment systems with a Rust backend, you should be telling your recruiter to look for profiles with Stripe or Paypal or Ayden integration experience, not just \"played with payments\" etc. \n\n3. **Recruiter is 1st interview** to confirm the person meets basic needs.\n\n4. **I was always the 2nd interview,** to confirm culture and diversity fits. If they weren't going to fit into the team, I didn't waste the team's time. \n\n5. **2-4 senior team member technical interview panel was the 3rd interview.** If the team didn't have 2-3 senior employees we'd borrow someone from an adjacent team. We offered two choices: share a repo with us of a project you implemented and we'll tear it apart with you to understand what and why you did, or build something that we suggest and we'll do the same. If someone passed this interview we could say yes. \n\nBonus: Just a 45 minute conversation commitment for the candidate but otherwise no homework needed\u2014it felt nice to respect their time and to hear someone be super excited about something they built.\n\n6. Sometimes more senior leadership wants to talk to someone, but after this process I was 95% sure that we had quality candidates who would get the yes. \n\nOverall, I'd talk to 10-20 people, send 4-6 to a team panel, and we'd get 2-3 to decide between. Goes surprisingly quick, and if you're in a higher hiring cadence, you keep those other 1-2 candidates warm and either try to hire them on other open reqs or refresh in a month when you list your next role. If you're always a little bit hiring, you keep a warm pipeline that you can tap very quickly and the time commitment goes down further.",
      "Read a story sometime ago about a manager who couldn't get shortlisted at his own company because of the resume filter in place that rejected his resume.

You need something that has (in general) right and wrong answers.\n\n3. Do the initial 30 minute filter call yourself. No way around that. Your goals here are: can we communicate on a basic level? Do they want this specific job or they just looking for a paycheck ? Do they really have experience (ask them to explain something on their resume)\n\n4. At the end of the call, tell them that is going to be background check (validating their resume) and 3 referrals (1 direct manager).

Sounds simple but you'd be surprised how many people fumble around or clearly don't have the tools they claim to use daily.\n\nFor question 7 - current tools are pretty useless tbh. LinkedIn feels like a wasteland now with all the AI spam. Most job boards are just resume dumps with zero verification.

For ATS, Lever seems to be the better of the lot.\n\nThe live project verification thing you mentioned is interesting. We've experimented with asking people to make small changes to staging environments or walk through specific parts of codebases they claim to have worked on. Works pretty well as a filter.\n\nWhat size team are you hiring for? The approach definitely changes based on whether you're trying to hire your first dev vs scaling to 20+",
      "I've hired about 500 people in my career and so I found a few things that work and what I found doesn't.\n\nI really prefer to hire people who are inexperienced situations where I'm their first or second job in the industry.\n\nReason being that this skips a lot of what you're talking about if you know that they're an experienced then you don't really have to pay attention to what AI tools they use direct resumes or how they're gonna misrepresent how they are you know that you're getting someone at the bottom. And honestly if I know or someone on my team knows how to do it. I much Rather the new tape members emulate my current rock stars and bring in a bunch of weird behaviors from who knows what companies they already failed at.\n\nYes thats obviously means that you have to build good training but if you want the company that can last you have to build good training anyways so why not get it out of the way early when the ideas and successes are fresh on your mind.\n\nThis strategy also often means cheaper initial hires so you can hire before you need people and that way by the time that you need them they're already geared up and running in a part of your team.\n\nCollege sucks so you have to be that nowadays.\n\nShow this plug I ended up building the software called humanagement for training people because Im obviously a big proponent of it but you can use any LMS or system as long as you train."

Given your post I\u2019m sure you understand this OP, but for all the non-tech founders, I think this is an important note. No software will EVER be perfect.

    "title": "Advice for Non-technical Founders - i will not promote",
    "selftext": "I just want to share a little success story. There are always a lot of non-technical founders on here looking for technical founders, and this story might help you.\n\nI was a non-technical founder. I had coded frontend stuff a little, but long enough ago that I no longer considered myself technical. I am a UX designer and product manager, and I hoped that would be enough. We have a SaaS-enabled marketplace, and we hired an overseas dev firm to build it for us.\n\nIt worked, but it was buggy and prone to crashing. I realized really quickly that starting without a technical co-founder had been a bad idea. I searched for one, but asking someone to take over a buggy, crashy platform that is not yet cash-positive was a difficult sell. I found a few people over time that were interested, but it never worked out and I don't blame them. Fundraising went poorly, maybe because our technical deficit was obvious (and marketplaces make people nervous anyway), so that was probably a red flag for potential co-founders, too.\n\nStill, we limped along and got customers. 2k customers, 4k transactions, $1.7M in GMV. It's working. But still buggy and new features were extremely slow to roll out.\n\nIt was really stressful to have a buggy platform that so many people were using. I dreaded weekends when the engineers wouldn't be around. A bug could cripple the whole platform and I'd have to wait until Monday for any help.\n\nThen AI started to get better and I could ask AI questions about the platform, the code, the infrastructure. I had AI create a curriculum for me to learn dev-ops, then git, then backend, and I'm still working on JS and our frontend framework. I took the courses and learned a lot. I started to understand object-oriented programming and code simple things. Then Cursor became a thing. We started shipping my code, and I could finally fix weekend bugs myself. I let our backend developer go. I let the rest of the engineering team go. Now I run the platform myself - at this point it's mostly maintaining and debugging, not a lot of building. My plan is to implement a test suite (we never had much unit or feature tests in place), and continue to learn more. I don't think it will be long before I'm able to not just maintain, but also build.\n\nI became the technical founder.\n\nI cut our burn by 90% and went from losing money to being cashflow-positive. It's still an uphill battle, marketplaces are as difficult as people say they are. I still have a lot to learn technically. I didn't get any better at fundraising and our GTM still needs work. But at least we're not constantly running out of money and within a few months of closing at any moment.\n\nLast night a bug popped up with one of our users. I deployed the fix 45 minutes later. I hope you can understand what a complete turn-around that is. It's transformational.\n\nSo, for all the non-technical founders out there - yes, you do need a technical founder. But maybe it's you?",
    "comments": [
      "As much as this is a message to non-tech founders, it\u2019s also a warning to technical founders.\n\nFor most SaaS startups, the tech isn\u2019t the hard part anymore. With the AI tools out, building an MVP is really not difficult for non-tech founders that actually believe in their ideas and have the grit to learn the tools. Sure the tools aren\u2019t perfect right now, but think about how much better they\u2019ve gotten over the past couple years? Even YC has admitted that a growing number of their founders are fully vibecoding their applications!\n\nIn a year, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if fully functioning MVPs could be created in a day for less than $50. The cost of code is dropping at an insane rate and with that a lot of leverage that technical cofounders had when negotiating with non-tech cofounders.\n\nThe hard part is more and more the business side of the startup. Before, tech cofounders had all the leverage because of the supply demand imbalance between business founders and tech founders but with AI it\u2019s creating a more balanced market. IMO this new post AI age of startups is gonna lead to a new paradigm of cofounder team makeup. Where it\u2019s gonna be less the current highly specialized makeup of tech and non-tech founders but more overlap where you have a group of semi-tech founders, where the business skills are prioritized.\n\nIf PMF can be found without a specialized tech-cofounder it is a scary world for the traditional tech cofounders who expect to get equal equity distribution & market rate salaries, all while expecting the business cofounder to have invested their own capital in the company, found traction and have an impressive resume, cause they are capable of refactoring the codebase to make it infinitely scalable. Why would a founder give up cofounder level equity when they could just raise capital off of the vibecoded MVP with PMF and then bring on a CTO or lead dev on just a market salary and employee #1 level equity?",
      "Holy smokes this is a valuable.",
      "3 years ago I tried, I tried again last week. Why not",
      "Respect for pushing through all that. Most people would\u2019ve quit when the platform started crashing. You didn\u2019t just build a product, you built grit",
      "Agree 100%",
      "Yo, that's a sick story! Been there with the buggy platform stress.\n\nI hear you on the tech co-founder struggle; feels impossible sometimes. Mad respect for leveling up your skills and taking control!",
      "I would say your background in front-end and UX were super valuable in this journey. As a person with zero experience in this space, I can tell you that no-coding gets me 20% of the way, but after that it would be fairly challenging. I can probably do it in time, but then I lose speed, while I better spend time on some other stuff that I actually know (fundraising, product dev, customer engagement, etc). Am I too pessimistic?",
      "Are you willing to share your study plan? Will be super helpful :)",
      "Agree. Hiring devs without first validating the problem is the fastest way to burn cash. Clarity before code every time. How did you validate your idea before building?",

Not going to go off buying Lambos, but there are some basics that I just need to have money to pay for. I have had some people say \"no way in the world, eat ramen, move your kids from their current schools, find somewhere where you don't have to pay rent\"...and others say \"well of course, they want you to be 150% in the business to make it a success and don't want you stressing about costs that you need to pay\". Anyway, keen to get others opinions.... tbh, I see the argument for both sides",

The right founders will do what they can (within reason) to extend personal runway.",
      "Paying people including yourself needs to be a part of your business plan. Everyone needs to be paid at least a minimal salary or some form of compensation. Why else would you do it? Otherwise, it\u2019s a hobby.",

      "Yea, if you're building something with real VC/investment, that will likely turn into real value, you get a modest salary.  Not 350k but 80-120 for a founder of an early stage is TOTALLY reasonable.  You need to eat, pay rent, pay bills and live.  \n\nThis only applies to real investment though.  If you got 10k from your bestie, that's not real investment.  It's investment, yes, but not the kind that allows you have have a real salary.",

The IRS will freak out if you aren't paid a \"reasonable wage\" for your position (so industry standard for early stage, or wherever you are at).\n\n\nIt's about tax evasion for them. Depending on how it's structured lower salary can mean more profit sharing (in non VC situations where distributions are the goal) and not having a real salary means an overall lower tax bill.\u00a0\n\n\nBecause of that headache alone I would expect any sane accountant to mandate you to take a reasonable salary.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm honestly not sure what kind of quantity you are asking about but I believe reasonable per the IRS is likely 70-120k right now for a funded founding C Suite role.\n\n\nAsk an actual tax advisor when you get funding, not Reddit please. It's a real business risk.",

Yes - it is acceptable if the compensation at an early stage is reasonable and really helps the founder move forward. There are industries in which employee salaries make up 90 percent of all funds. At growth stages, investors encourage founders to spend their money on hiring employees to ensure growth. Once again, yes, it is acceptable, everyone understands everything. Precisely because everyone understands everything, it should be reasonable. Be honest with your investors.",

    "title": "The 3-Month Rule: My Coding Framework for Things That Don't Scale (i will not promote)",
    "selftext": "Everyone knows Paul Graham's advice: \"Do things that don't scale.\" But nobody talks about how to implement it in coding.\n\nI've been building my AI podcast platform for 8 months, and I've developed a simple framework: every unscalable hack gets exactly 3 months to live. After that, it either proves its value and gets properly built, or it dies.\n\nHere's the thing: as engineers, we're trained to build \"scalable\" solutions from day one. Design patterns, microservices, distributed systems - all that beautiful architecture that handles millions of users. But that's big company thinking.\n\nAt a startup, scalable code is often just expensive procrastination. You're optimizing for users who don't exist yet, solving problems you might never have. My 3-month rule forces me to write simple, direct, \"bad\" code that actually ships and teaches me what users really need.\n\n**My Current Infrastructure Hacks and Why They're Actually Smart:**\n\n**1. Everything Runs on One VM**\n\nDatabase, web server, background jobs, Redis - all on a single $40/month VM. Zero redundancy. Manual backups to my local machine.\n\nHere's why this is genius, not stupid: I've learned more about my actual resource needs in 2 months than any capacity planning doc would've taught me. Turns out my \"AI-heavy\" platform peaks at 4GB RAM. The elaborate Kubernetes setup I almost built? Would've been managing empty containers.\n\nWhen it crashes (twice so far), I get real data about what actually breaks. Spoiler: It's never what I expected.\n\n**2. Hardcoded Configuration Everywhere**\n\n    PRICE_TIER_1 = 9.99\n    PRICE_TIER_2 = 19.99\n    MAX_USERS = 100\n    AI_MODEL = \"gpt-4\"\n\nNo config files. No environment variables. Just constants scattered across files. Changing anything means redeploying.\n\nThe hidden superpower: I can grep my entire codebase for any config value in seconds. Every price change is tracked in git history. Every config update is code-reviewed (by me, looking at my own PR, but still).\n\nBuilding a configuration service would take a week. I've changed these values exactly 3 times in 3 months. That's 15 minutes of redeployment vs 40 hours of engineering.\n\n**3. SQLite in Production**\n\nYes, I'm running SQLite for a multi-user web app. My entire database is 47MB. It handles 50 concurrent users without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe learning: I discovered my access patterns are 95% reads, 5% writes. Perfect for SQLite. If I'd started with Postgres, I'd be optimizing connection pools and worrying about replication for a problem that doesn't exist. Now I know exactly what queries need optimization before I migrate.\n\n**4. No CI/CD, Just Git Push to Production**\n\n    git push origin main && ssh server \"cd app && git pull && ./restart.sh\"\n\nOne command. 30 seconds. No pipelines, no staging, no feature flags.\n\nWhy this teaches more than any sophisticated deployment setup: Every deployment is intentional. I've accidentally trained myself to deploy small, focused changes because I know exactly what's going out. My \"staging environment\" is literally commenting out the production API keys and running locally.\n\n**5. Global Variables for State Management**\n\n    active_connections = {}\n    user_sessions = {}\n    rate_limit_tracker = defaultdict(list)\n\nShould these be in Redis? Absolutely. Are they? No. Server restart means everyone logs out.\n\nThe insight this gave me: Users don't actually stay connected for hours like I assumed. Average session is 7 minutes. The elaborate session management system I was planning? Complete overkill. Now I know I need simple JWT tokens, not a distributed session store.\n\n**The Philosophy:**\n\nBad code that ships beats perfect code that doesn't. But more importantly, bad code that teaches beats good code that guesses.\n\nEvery \"proper\" solution encodes assumptions:\n\n* Kubernetes assumes you need scale\n* Microservices assume you need isolation\n* Redis assumes you need persistence\n* CI/CD assumes you need safety\n\nAt my stage, I don't need any of that. I need to learn what my 50 users actually do. And nothing teaches faster than code that breaks in interesting ways.\n\n**The Mental Shift:**\n\nI used to feel guilty about every shortcut. Now I see them as experiments with expiration dates. The code isn't bad - it's perfectly calibrated for learning mode.\n\nIn 3 months, I'll know exactly which hacks graduate to real solutions and which ones get deleted forever. That's not technical debt - that's technical education.",

Turns out, distribution, feedback loops, and relentless iteration matter just as much, if not more.   \n  \nI\u2019ve heard others talk about unlearning things like:\n\n  \n\u2022 If you build it, they will come; not without distribution they won't.   \n\u2022 You need to raise money to be taken seriously; many startup are not taken seriously even after multiple funding rounds  \n\u2022 A co-founder should be your best friend; no they do not, good chemistry, values and discipline over history, always!   \n  \nThese are some of my epiphanies, What belief did you have to unlearn the hard way?",

      "Great question! In our experience, particularly in fast-moving fields like marketing, human involvement will become more about strategic direction and less about granular execution. AI will handle tasks, but humans will be essential for ensuring quality, ethical alignment, and making sense of outputs from potentially *complex* AI *tools*. It's almost like *juggling* different AI capabilities to achieve a cohesive strategy. For supervision, probably a mix: core full-time roles for strategy/QA, and specialized on-demand talent for specific reviews.",

That's a super interesting question about human-in-the-loop.\n\nI read a case study where startups using AI for customer service still needed humans to handle complex or sensitive cases, especially for retaining older customers.

    "selftext": "What\u2019s good guys - thank you all for the positive notes on the market validation stack (search for: \"Guide: I use this prompt stack to kill weak startup ideas in under 30 minutes\")\n\nThe next step is to pull that competitive wedge you have into a brand statement. This is so important - you treat this as the spine of your messaging. Every piece of content needs to ladder up to this. It gives u laser focused targeting and lets you speak in one language. This will set the tone for your - home page, sales deck, elevator pitch & ads\u2026 the lot.\u00a0\n\nAgain, this is literally what we figure out with top tier ad agencies and global heads of strategy when we have a new product or are creating a new category.\u00a0\n\nNOTE: you need to run the previous prompts from the above post to ensure it is trained correctly on your startup. \n\nRun each one at a time, in the same chat window. Once done, do the same for the following:\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **Prompt: Positioning Statement Synthesiser**\n\nUsing all prior inputs - product, audience, transformation, positioning axis, write 5 one-line brand statements.\n\nEach line must:\n\n* Be at or under 15 words\n* Instantly signal your value prop\n* Include either outcome, wedge, or key differentiator\n* Avoid abstract phrases like \u201cempower\u201d or \u201credefine\u201d\n* Avoid internal-facing terms (e.g. \u201cmarketing system,\u201d \u201cautomation\u201d) unless the ICP uses them natively\n\nOutput Format:\n\n* Statement 1\n* Statement 2\n\n\\- - -\u00a0\n\nPlay around with the outputs and refine.\u00a0\n\nNext step, which I like to do right before seeking Product Market Fit is a quick pricing economics sanity check. This lets you reverse engineer your customer acquisition costs, flags risks, suggests the max u can afford to make a sale per channel and more. This is SO important to figure out sooner than later. It answers:\n\n* What channels can I actually afford?\u00a0\n* If I am a loss leader, how long can I survive for?\n* How lean are competitors margins if they can pay for this?\u00a0\n* What is the LTV (lifetime value) per customer?\u00a0\n* Do I need to refine my pricing, bundling, or upselling to maintain margin?\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **Prompt: Pricing & CAC Validator**\n\nYou are now operating in Strategic Economics Mode.\n\nYou have already been trained on:\n\n* The business, audience, and product\n* The market strategy and positioning\n* Estimated delivery cost (COGS)\n* Go-to-market mode\n* Key channels\u00a0\n\nRun this pricing model using all known inputs so far.\n\nYour job:\n\n\u2192 Calculate breakeven CAC\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2192 Suggest CAC ceilings by channel\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2192 Flag pricing risks based on margin, retention, or funnel friction\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2192 Recommend upsells, bundles, or pricing tiers if needed\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2192 Model breakeven conversion rates if using paid ads\n\nThen return:\n\n1. Breakeven CAC (based on COGS + price)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2. CAC Ceiling (for 3:1 ROAS or 30% margin)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3. Suggested pricing tiers or bundles (if needed)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n4. GTM friction score (Low / Medium / High)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n5. CAC payback period (if subscription)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n6. Viable channels with ROAS sensitivity\u00a0\u00a0\n\n7. Profit per sale\u00a0\u00a0\n\n8. Minimum viable CR (conversion rate) for profitability\u00a0\u00a0\n\n9. Key pricing risks\u00a0\u00a0\n\n10. Strategic recommendation: Hold, Raise, Tier, or Restructure\n\nIf data is missing, ask. If still no confirmation then use trained inference and explain your assumptions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEmbed all prior model memory into reasoning.\n\n\\- - -\u00a0\n\nSee what you get. This should deepen your clarity and the first step in creating a bridge from your marketing strategy to your marketing execution.\u00a0\n\nThis is the 9/10th prompt and the next 70 help me automate my marketing team to create holistic and concise assets which all speak the same language, to the same target, solving the same problem.

    "selftext": "Lately, I\u2019ve been thinking, as a founder, how much does being visible on the internet matter?\n\nWe often hear about building in public, posting on Twitter or LinkedIn, sharing our journey, and doing podcasts, among other things. But what if you're not naturally wired for that? What if you\u2019re introverted, or just not comfortable being that \u201cvisible\u201d all the time?\n\nIs it possible to still grow your startup and earn trust without constantly putting yourself out there?\n\nI\u2019m genuinely curious how others feel. Are you forcing yourself to post more? Or have you found other ways to build trust and visibility without being front and center?\n\nI especially want to hear from introverted founders: how are you navigating this?",
    "comments": [
      "IMO creating an online presence or becoming a business influencer of sorts is pretty overrated. For most people you will probably hurt yourself more than help yourself if you try to force yourself into becoming some online personality. IMO it often comes off as disingenuous when i see and read the stuff some founders post. \n\nYou do not need to have an online presence to have a big successful company. That\u2019s what marketing teams are for. Personally I would rather my product/company speak for itself. If you have a product that is a 10x solution to a customers problem they will not care how many social media followers are or what quotes you post on LinkedIn.\n\nWhere that stuff helps is in the small business and early stage startup phase where you don\u2019t have brand or product recognition and so you create an online presence for recognition.",
      "It depends on what you're trying to do, but generally speaking I'd say that the best entrepreneurs that I know are heads down focusing on work and their private lives.\n\nYes, a number of them went through phases where you saw them everywhere because of either their projects getting visibility or their participation in events, but after a while they stopped wasting their time on that.\n\nIn either case I'd say don't go for visibility to be visible, get visibility because of genuine progress. Even if it's more personal social media you should focus on what you're doing in that minute or have done, and not go on full blast every time you've get a new thought about something that you're (maybe) going to do, or every damn random opinion that pops into your head.\n\nYou're not an authoritative force and leader that need to proclaim your thoughts every single time you read something in the news.\n\nBe humble. Talk about what you've locked in. And if you haven't locked anything in, then you don't get the \"reward\" of allowing yourself to make a post, no matter how much you want to or think your post history is looking empty. Progress first, post later.",
      "it is possible to grow without but it makes your life more complicated depending on the product.\n\nI\u2019m a first time founder, i\u2019m extroverted when it comes to work but incredibly introverted in my day to day lives, but I\u2019ve worked and consulted for founders on building online presence. \n\nThere are multiple solutions to the problem of building the brand up, but honestly it comes down to what you want\n\n1. You have a co founder who wants to do podcasts, being online, post about growth, share blogs and updates.\n2. You build that skillset yourself and work on it daily to grow the brand and have fun with it.\n3. You hire someone to do the marketing / relationship work for the company (this isn\u2019t really an option in the beginning)\n\nTo give some stats from our company, it\u2019s been around 2 years, a real company for 18 months.\n\n- 70% of inbound comes from posting on twitter / linkedIn, podcasts, youtube directly\n\n- 15% comes from google from the above \n\n- 15% is organic\n\nWe process 1-2 billion of requests a month.\n\nI do everything to talk about the company as much as possible, I chalk it up to making the company succeed. Do I force myself, probably less than most as I enjoy seeing the work convert.\n\nMy cofounder on the other hand does minimal in the space because he hates it all and would rather be in the weeds every minute he can.",
      "I do software in the nightlife industry and I think being searchable is important *for this industry* so I make it a point to post once a week, give updates, be moving, take pics with people at our clients bars. \n\nBut if anything it\u2019s a way for me to have an excuse to continue to build rapport with clients and speak to users. It makes me feel better and I do know some of my clients have searched me before and seeing \u201coh, he works with _____\u201d gives me some credibility. But I think this is specific to my industry and even more specific to the tech I\u2019m selling.",
      "It\u2019s definitely important. Think of it as another marketing channel rather than about becoming an influencer.",
      "You don\u2019t have to be loud to build trust. Many introverted founders grow through small communities, great products, or thoughtful writing. Platforms like [Ollin.com](https://ollin.com) let you build in public your way\u2014with support, not pressure.",
      "I'm a founder on my second tech company, and am very introverted. The company is still at a very early stage. I have proof-of-concept, and am trying to get to a prototype. \n\nI generally don't use social media for myself. Being active on social media is too important not to do, though. So I created a Blue Sky account, haven't made a dedicated LinkedIn profile for the company yet, but am active on Reddit. I've been posting about the progress of the proof-of-concept, and have a subreddit that, while not directly related to my product, is about an important part of my product's tech stack. The subreddit is r/supriya_python. So there's some overlap. I try to work on my product, then do something for my subreddit, then go back to the product, etc. At this stage, it's also hard to post regularly about the product. So having something else I can post about helps. Recently I've been focusing more on the subreddit, but that ends up contributing to my product, as I'll incorporate things from the subreddit into the product eventually. Anyway, any exposure I get on the subreddit can only help my company.\n\nI don't ever take pictures of myself, or film my face, though. That's probably where my introversion comes into play. People like video, so having some is important. However, depending on your company's product, you don't have to show yourself. My company's product is an electronic music instrument. So all I have to do is make videos of the instrument being played. I don't really need to show anything more than my hands playing the instrument.",

But many good consumer tools survive without this, so not a prerequisite at all! \n\nI follow some good founders like Jack Friks from Postbridge, Peter Levels (of course) and others whose online presence acts like a flywheel for people to check out their products. But if you asked me who made my Garmin, or Neon database - I don't need to know.",
      "You\u2019ll need a brand, media presence. Visibility is important",
      "I think it makes alot of sense to put yourself out there in a VSL, be authentic, show how you can solve problems etc.\n\nAs an introvert myself, I've found that video content actually works way better than constantly posting on social - you can script it out, do multiple takes, and really think through what you want to say instead of having to be \"on\" all the time on social media.\n\nUsing teleprompters online can help ease that stress of being on camera. You can write out exactly what you want to communicate, practice it a few times, and then record when you feel ready. Way less pressure than trying to freestyle or constantly come up with social media content.\n\nThe key is being genuine about the problems your solving. People connect with authenticity way more than perfect presentation anyway.\n\nDon't want to self promote but if anybody wants a clean teleprompter I'm using, DM me and I'll send it. I built one because the existing ones were either buggy or had anoying scrolling issues.\n\nThis is just a starting point for examples, but I think introverts can actually have an advantage - we tend to be better listeners and more thoughtfull about what we share, which can lead to higher quality content even if it's less frequent.\n\nhonestly wish more people talked about this because the \"build in public\" thing can be exhausting when your not naturally wired for it",
      "You don\u2019t have to be loud to be trusted. Consistency, clarity, and great work build just as much credibility. Visibility helps, but authenticity keeps people around",
      "My cofounder is pretty well known in his business niche. It helped us get the product in front of people I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been able to on my own. However, this was a minor advantage for us.\n\n1. My cofounder is extraordinarily stubborn and unwilling to pivot from his initial idea at all.\n2. If the product doesn\u2019t serve anyone well, it will still fail. All the usual startup rules apply. It was just slightly easier to get feedback from some people in the media, influencers, etc.",
      "It's not necessary. Sure, people who thrive on online visibility and social interaction will bang on about how incredibly important it is, and that's fine for them - they enjoy doing that and can probably get more out of it.",
      "I have the same challenge as well, but what I have discovered is that. Use the easiest medium for you. Whether it\u2019s written form on LinkedIn or video on YouTube. And even carousels on instagram. \n\nFor me I only aim to reach 1 follower whose goal align mine, those are the types of people you wanna work with. \n\nDon\u2019t think of it as being famous but rather as a way to share stories and grow an audience.",
      "Not everyone needs to be loud online... but someone on your team needs to be discoverable and trusted. Doesn\u2019t have to be you.\n\nThat said, visibility \u2260 virality. You don\u2019t need to tweet daily or go on podcasts. You just need to exist online in a way that builds confidence: clear bio, sharp positioning, proof you\u2019re solving something real.\n\nSome introverted founders I know win by:  \n\u2192 Writing deep-dive blog posts instead of short-form noise  \n\u2192 Commenting meaningfully on niche threads (vs. posting their own)  \n\u2192 Letting early users/clients become the loud advocates instead\n\nAlso, visibility can be time-boxed. You don\u2019t have to be \"on\" forever. Build your footprint when you need it.. fundraising, recruiting, launching, then go heads-down again.",
      "It's definitely quite important. And building a brand gives you a lot of leverage. You won't have to chase clients either after a while. But you have to build it right. \n\n  \nFor me, I was quite introverted too when I started out. Didn't even want to put my face out there, or my name. So I took it step by step. And now, I am comfortable sharing a part of my life, or process of building my firm with other people in a similar case as me. \n\n  \nSo ultimately, you end up creating a story for yourself. And putting yourself out there become easier with time.",
      "In todays competitive environment, I think It's absolutely critical.\n\nWhen I launched my startup 12 months ago I already had an audience of 20 000+ people on LinkedIn that were a fit for that specific product. Without that, I'm not sure it would have even taken off in the first place.\n\nI definately felt uncomfortable when I started posting a couple of years ago but after a while you get the hang of it, and I'd say I'm not super extrovert.",
      "Literally battling this right now because I\u2019m so introverted and I hate being sucked into social media black hole",
      "So far I\u2019ve been hiding from public view. I do create content based on my personal experience & reach out to people using my name but I do not show my face. I also use separate accounts to promote my product. It\u2019s not really because of being introvert but more so because I don\u2019t want my friends or family to know about my product (yet). The only place I promote as me is LinkedIn but even then I blocked all family members & friends before launching.",

I want to start my next project.\n\nthe concept idea is basically futuristic (i love scifi), I want to create a physical thumb size memory device, where each person can have their own original AI persona. \n\nThis device will have all their data, even financial, health, credentials to apps, etc!\n\nnow, in order to use this, you will need to plug it into any device to utilize the computing power, and basically do anything through your AI, send message (omg! this is a great idea too! AI persona based messenger!!), buy stuff, login and do many stuff.\n\nit will a computing power grid where each of our AI assistant can dive and perform stuff.\n\nI think this is the future, instead of us having to have each own servers and what not, and pay for server or saas, we can just on a national grid of computing power, and take full advantage of the net.\n\nno need for SaaS and coding! your AI does that.\n\nI think it'd be cool! \n\nshare your thoughts.

      "\n\nThis isn\u2019t really a startup idea, it\u2019s a 10-year ecosystem play.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between a startup idea and a speculative infrastructure shift. You\u2019re proposing a future that requires its own cloud layer, identity protocol, secure hardware, and AI orchestration fabric. That\u2019s nation-state or FAANG-level architecture, not something you spin up with a cofounder and a deck.\n\nIdeas like this are great , we need sci-fi to aim at ,but unless you deeply understand the technical bottlenecks (e.g. secure inference at the edge, decentralized compute coordination, cross-app agent control) you\u2019re not building a startup. You\u2019re making a map of the future.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad thing! But don\u2019t confuse ideation with execution. The real challenge isn\u2019t ever coming up with the concept,  it\u2019s breaking it down into a wedge you can actually build.",

It might be more interesting to discuss this in a Sci-fi or fantasy subreddit, but I don't see how this is related to startups.\n\nAnyways, the last time I used a thumb drive was like 10 years ago. How is that futuristic?\n\nAnd another thought is why not make this entire infrastructure accessible via biometric information, allowing us to access our data and systems from any device without needing another physical key?\n\nOf course this idea is a government-level or even inter-governmental infrastructure project that I don't think can be achieved even by the most powerful corporations today.",

      "Absolutely!",
      "Depends on the stage you are in. I agree with all the other advice to focus on value proposition if you are starting out. Once you have traction, I recommend\n1/ tracking retention and losing to customers to your competition\n2/ track win rate vs. competitors\n3/ protect your moat",
      "It really depends on your business type and industry target. Usually it's better just to focus on your customers and just occasionally see what your competitors are doing to get an idea of where the industry is going towards. \n\nThe exception I would say to this is if your startup is really deep tech with a winner take all market that if you lose you would instantly lose the entire market in a year or two if you cannot match them.",
      "I\u2019ve built a few brands over the years and honestly, I do think it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on competitors, but with balance. If you're checking their site daily or trying to match every new feature, it becomes a distraction.\n\nHow often or how deep you go depends on your type of business. I\u2019ll speak from the DTC angle since that\u2019s where I have the experience.\n\nFor pricing, I like to keep a regular pulse. In competitive categories, a sudden discount push or bundle shift from a rival can start impacting your numbers pretty quickly. Tools like Particl or Shine Commerce can give you a sense of what\u2019s happening out there -- although like anything, take it all as directional, not gospel. Particl puts out some free industry snapshots too, like average discounting benchmarks by category. And if you\u2019re in CPG, StartupCPG shares free weekly data drops with Nielsen insights, which are genuinely helpful.\n\nWhen it comes to ads, I\u2019ll usually do a monthly sweep using the ad libraries from Meta, TikTok, Google, Reddit, etc. You can get a sense of which angles competitors are testing and where they\u2019re putting their budget. For more traditional stuff like native or TV, I\u2019ve found iSpot and Adbeat pretty handy. Some newer AI tools like Arcads let you scan ad creative and generate mockups or copy too -- good for idea-starters, but again, not something to copy.\n\nTech stack-wise, if you're curious what software others are running, BuiltWith is great for a full breakdown and ShopScan is super easy if you're mostly looking at other Shopify sites.\n\nThat said, I still believe the most valuable work is staying insanely close to your own customer. Tools like Answer the Public and Answer Socrates are great for finding real questions people are asking. SparkToro helps you figure out where your audience actually spends time online -- podcasts, websites, communities -- and I\u2019ve used that a bunch when planning content or partnerships.\n\nIf you\u2019re into buyer psychology, I\u2019d recommend the book *Marketing to Mindstates*. It helped me shift how I think about messaging -- less about what I want to say, more about how people are making decisions emotionally.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re using AI for research, don\u2019t just have it summarize sites. Ask it to take on the role of a \u201ccustomer-insight archaeologist.\u201d Prompt it to dig into pain points, unmet needs, hidden anxieties. Works surprisingly well if you feed it reviews, Reddit threads, etc.",
      "I think it's important to keep track just to stay on your toes and maintain a defensible moat for your product when pitching to investors. But I think it's market dependent - some markets are big enough to house multiple competitors doing the same thing. Also agree that it's all about execution at the end of the day.",
      "IMHO it\u2019s all about balance. My customers determine who my competitors are. I follow the top five on LinkedIn and I use tools like getstrata.ai and Grok to occasionally look up news/changes to their positioning. But otherwise heads down working on the product and how it resonates w customers.\u00a0",
      "It\u2019s smart to keep an eye on competitors but it\u2019s also key not to obsess over them and lose focus on your customer At the same time, listening closely to your customers and iterating based on their feedback keeps you unique and relevant.

We've built an AI-powered platform that helps consumers compare and purchase service contracts from multiple providers, essentially bringing transparency to an industry known for high pressure sales and hidden fees.\n\n**Current traction on own own:**\n\n* Hundreds of of weekly quotes generated since launch, with sales.\n* 13+ provider partnerships signed\n* Strong validation of marketplace concept\n* Limited sales so far\n\n**The opportunity:**\n\n* 50/50 partnership with industry veteran who built and successfully exited a major company in our space\n* They bring established provider relationships, complementary AI Voice technology, and existing customer acquisition infrastructure. Basically, we will be the brain for his AI Agents.\n* We bring our marketplace platform, AI recommendation engine, early traction, and technical team\n* Claims 18-month path to profitability vs. 3-5 years with traditional VC route\n* Joint venture valued higher than our current funding discussions\n* We would aim for a double, targeting $50M ARR with strong EBITDA margins, rather than swinging for a $100M+ exit.\n\n**My concerns:**\n\n* Giving up control/ownership vs. maintaining majority through funding\n* Partnership conflicts and decision-making complexity\n* Missing out on traditional startup ecosystem benefits\n* Risk of being junior partner despite 50/50 split\n\n**Context:**\n\n* We need some salary to survive and execute\n* Traditional funding path would require multiple rounds with significant dilution\n* Industry veteran has real credibility and relationships we can't replicate quickly\n* Our tech is innovative but we're still building out customer acquisition channel.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. How do you evaluate partnership vs. funding for early-stage companies?\n2. What red flags should I watch for in partnership structures?\n3. Anyone have experience with partnerships that have worked?\n4. How do you maintain control in 50/50 partnerships?\n\nAppreciate any insights from founders who've faced similar decisions.

      "Hi all, thanks for all the great suggestions over the weekend.  This is exactly why I posted to get good  feedback from you all it\u2019s really appreciated!

I\u2019ve already worked out so far 5 milestones etc and working on tying  the hires to them.\n\n1. Clarify Your Funding Use:\n\n\u2022\tInvestors want to hear how money will grow the business, not just cover expenses.\n\n\u2022\tFocus on metrics like revenue growth, ARR, and time to profitability.\n\n\u2022\tClearly explain how each hire will directly impact growth and remove bottlenecks.\n\n2. Right-Sizing Your Round:\n\n\u2022\tThe market has shifted from 18 to 24-month runways being the norm.\n\n\u2022\tWhile raising for 2 years is ideal, some suggest splitting raises (e.g. raise $1M now, $1M later).\n\n\u2022\tBe cautious with over-optimistic valuations (e.g. $20M may not be realistic early on).\n\n3. Consider a SAFE:\n\n\u2022\tUsing a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) can streamline early-stage fundraising.\n\n\u2022\tTry not to give up more than 10\u201315% equity in your initial round.\n\n4. Fundraising Strategy Suggestions:\n\n\u2022\tBootstrap until \\~150\u2013200k revenue, then raise a proper round to reach $500k+ ARR.\n\n\u2022\tAlternatively, raise what you can now due to tough market conditions, and optimize later.\n\n5. Build Internal Milestones:\n\n\u2022\tEstablish clear short-term goals (e.g. user growth, product milestones, ARR targets).\n\n\u2022\tUse these milestones to track progress, build investor confidence, and support future raises.\n\n\u2022\tHighlight how each funding round ties directly to achievable business outcomes.\n\n6. Cautionary Notes:\n\n\u2022\tFundraising is a major distraction\u2014only do it if really needed.\n\n\u2022\tAvoid stretching employee growth too far unless revenue supports it.\n\nSummary Insight:\n\nBuild a compelling growth narrative tied to clear milestones and metrics. Raise what you can realistically support, protect equity early on, and ensure every dollar raised is tied to meaningful progress. Keep the focus on long-term growth and returns when speaking to investors.",

I\u2019ve come up with an app based startup to fill this gap, I\u2019ve ran multiple polls and even in person surveys and have compiled a large amount of feedback from Soldiers and what they\u2019d like to see included in this app, over 500 individuals I\u2019ve talked to and 98% of them have stated they would absolutely use this app. I applied to NIS SBIR with the goal of trying to use phase 1 funding to bring on a couple contracted developers to design a MVP, unfortunately, my NIS SBIR was denied, DoD SBIR is based off solicitations and at the moment there are no solicitations that are in the realm of my idea. I\u2019ve attempted to build the app myself using no-code sources but unfortunately the functions I and the majority of the people I have surveyed want are just a little too complex for me to implement. My path forward now is to just bootstrap this myself and pay out of pocket for a developer to design me a MVP.

At Twine we work with tons of founders in similar spots. For a decent mobile app MVP you're probably looking at $15-25k range and 2-4 months depending on complexity. Could be less if you really strip it down to core features.\n\n\n\nFew things that'll save you headaches:\n\n\n\nStart with defining your absolute must-have features vs nice-to-haves. Write everything down in detail - user flows, screens, what happens when someone clicks each button etc. The clearer you are upfront the less back and forth later.\n\n\n\nDon't go with whoever quotes lowest price. Look for devs who've actually built similar apps, especially if theres any community/social features involved. Ask to download and test apps they've shipped to real app stores.\n\n\n\nMake sure they understand app store submission processes too, Apple especially can be picky about compliance stuff.\n\n\n\nYour military background probably gives you good project management instincts which helps a lot. Most founders struggle with scope creep but sounds like you're disciplined about requirements gathering.\n\n\n\nOne option is finding a dev who's military or has military connections - they might have better instinct for what veterans actually need vs what sounds good on paper.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of core functionality are you thinking? That might help narrow down what specific skills to prioritize when hiring."

      "Good for you for seeking this out, particularly the in person part.  A couple tips from a 15 year sales guy turned startup guy.  \n\nThe most available people are often the least valuable (no offense intended).  You and your cofounder should write down your ideal sales mentor - their background, area of expertise, and level of involvement with you.  Then go find those people on LinkedIn and reach out to them with the ask.  Sales people are the easiest to reach out to. \n\nBe cautious about how good us career sales folks get at selling ourselves.  Just show some reasonable skepticism knowing the people you are talking to make a living by positioning things.  \n\nFinally, you probably already know this, but the best mentorship relationships I have take a while to yield fruit. People who claim to be able to give you all the answers out of the gate tend to be the same who charge for consulting, which isn\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for.  This means you\u2019ll be doing some teaching too about your area of expertise."

And then there is never any time for anything \"extra\" like any thorough testing or anything.\n\n\nMy current project is a medical reviews automation system that uses AI agents to automatically make determinations about medical necessity based on state guidelines and case details. It has HIPAA requirements and is pushing the latest models to their limits.\n\n\nI built a fully custom system in a few months.

Generally big feature tickets pass after 1 or 2 iterations and bugfix tickets pass first time.\n\nWe also have offshore contractors who I do most of the QA for. Their work is full of bugs and they implement maybe 40% of a ticket before marking it done. I sometimes need to send tickets back to them 6-7 times and each time they slowly edge closer to completion. Sometimes I explicitly tell them what changes to make in C# so they can just copy/paste it because it's easier than expecting them to fix stuff themselves. Honestly, it feels like they're using ChatGPT to do a ticket, commit the changes after a prompt and mark it done for me to test lol",
      "My advice as someone who has worked extensively with both foreign and domestic software developers: if you yourself do not have sufficient technical expertise to be able to identify when a tech person is bullshitting you, do NOT hire a la carte foreign devs to build your product. It never ever goes well. \n\nWhatever low hourly rate you get, you will end up paying 10x more in inefficiency and rebuilds.\n\nOther solution is to find a domestic agency you trust who contracts with foreign devs they manage. This will give you a better price and more assurance that the project is progressing.\n\nAlso understand that timelines always have a margin of error because a lot depends on the existing code base and problems therein.",
      "If you have a local dev you trust, you can have them pick offshore devs and manage their work. It's a hit and miss only if you want to pay gambling rates. Pay decent, check their history, start small and increase amount of work gradually and you'll be fine. (I'm an offshore dev serving clients through upwork). If your intention of an offshore dev is to pay less, it probably will fail. Because talented people (and clients who want to hire them) compete online in a global marketplace so eventually good ones increase their rates.",

      "Been down this road multiple times across different companies. Here's what actually works:\n\nSkip the big platforms like Upwork initially - you'll waste weeks sorting through a lot of unqualified resumes. Better to start with referrals from other founders or smaller agencies that specialize in placing offshore talent.\n\nThe key thing most people mess up is the vetting process. Don't just look at portfolios, give them a small PAID test project first (maybe $200-500). You'll learn more in one week about how they actually work than months of interviews. Watch how they communicate, handle deadlines, and ask questions when stuck.\n\nFor managing them - over communicate everything upfront. Document your processes, create detailed specs, and setup daily standups. The timezone thing is actually an advantage if you structure it right - they work while you sleep.\n\nCommunication varies wildly by person, not just country. I've had devs from Eastern Europe who were better at updates than some US contractors, and others who disappeared for days. That's why the test project is crucial.\n\nOverall I'd recommend but with caveats - start small, vet thoroughly, and have your local team review their code initially. Don't offshore anything mission critical until you've worked together for months.\n\nThe cost savings are real but factor in extra management time on your end, especially the first few projects.\n\nWhat specific type of development work are you looking to offshore? That changes the recommendation quite a bit.",

I\u2019ve even applied to Y Combinator, and will be applying to a bunch of grants this year. To offset the $2K/month developer. I\u2019ve ensured that all legal documentation came from my end so that I have full control on how things work and that I can end the contract with him at any time if I feel as though the developer isn\u2019t doing what I need done within the time allotted. It also ensures I have some control over my cash burn rate vs level of performance and efficiency. \n\nMy advice to you:\n\nKnow how much business legal power you ACTUALLY have. And leverage that with any and all persons you work with in the future. For a lean MVP, if you should be working with someone who wants payment, let it be done within $10K or less. And let that lean mvp be a source of natural funding masked as revenue for your company.

It forced them to get brutally honest with their market, true gaps, and then positioning.

      "My first thought was to create a micro Saas from this, so I will validate that idea with this. :D",
      "Right answer. Most businesses fail. That validation which doesn't produce more invalidations is no validation at all. Frankly, the process should be called invalidation to get one's head screwed on straight. \n\nY Combinator tasks founders with finding \"hair on fire\" problems. However, founders much prefer any lame excuse to start. You might get some upvotes. But as soon as a vast majority find their first two or three ideas get shot down, they will stop. \n\nJust within the last couple of months I've read a new take on validation: Skip It. I predict this will become a best practice within the year. Because, as with bastardizing validation to generate false positives, it gives founders what they really want. \n\nThey won't say that out loud. Certainly never admit it to themselves. But that is irrelevant, for they will do what they always have. Founders purport to develop a product, a service. In actuality they work to develop a reality distortion field.

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been working in the AI/ML space since finishing undergrad a couple years ago, specifically on the development side. Having now become intimately familiar with deep learning and how these models work at a low level, my \u2018hot take\u2019 is that there are some built-in limitations with the transformer architecture used in LLM\u2019s and how these models internalize or \u2018learn\u2019 facts/conceptual knowledge. I think at some point (in the not-so-distant future), the scaling law we\u2019ve observed with transformers in recent years (where capabilities have generally scaled up with model size/complexity and hence GPU requirements) will plateau. \n\nI could go on ad nauseam about this, but I believe tackling some of these limitations could, among other things, ultimately produce a model(s) virtually incapable of outputting anything factually false, logically invalid, or that otherwise deviates from some user-defined set of rules. I don\u2019t think I need to justify the use case for such a system\u2014just consider how much you\u2019d trust ChatGPT to draft a lawsuit today with zero human intervention (I absolutely would not, not to mention it\u2019s difficult to check for correctness without a legal background).\n\nAs time goes on, I\u2019m developing a clearer idea of how I\u2019d tackle some of these problems and what doing so would entail. In the last few years, I\u2019ve connected with some very smart people I would team up with in a heartbeat, as well as VC\u2019s/people on the funding side of things, and the more I think about it, the more I wonder if this is a venture I should seriously pursue.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to think through a timeline and what a business plan might look like. Particularly in the earlier stages, it would all be about R&D (huge emphasis on the R) and building IP\u2014think a team of 5-10 PhD\u2019s and developers putting their heads together, prototyping, conducting experiments, etc\u2026 and building a v1 piece by piece (then seed/series a funding). I almost see it more like a biotech startup than an AI one.\n\nLooking at the current state of the industry, however, it seems like the major players mainly compete on their (inference) services and other things largely unrelated to hard proprietary research (in fact, it seems like most major breakthroughs have been detailed and published publicly as papers).\n\nTo anyone familiar with this space, how do you think an AI startup primarily focused on cutting-edge research should plan its medium to long-term strategy in order to secure a market position (especially considering the prevalent culture of transparency and open sourcing)? Do you think it\u2019s possible to build a successful AI company primarily on IP or do you need to position yourself as a service-provider, too?",

From what you describe, I'd have to assume you'd be able to land on your feet at a new company down the line if you can't pull this off. But, if you do have family, there's a lot more at risk that would just depend on your financial situation, partner's willingness to potentially need to step up from an income pov, potential time away from family while you're raising/building, etc. I left a cushy job a few years ago to start my own thing.

You either need a ton of money to hire the people you need or convince them to cofound with you. Either way, you have to find people with the aptitude and attitude to build an early stage start up. Those are hard to find. You need to do a lot of selling to potential co-founders and/or investors, and both of those will require you to have a lot of evidence your idea has potential and you're able to realize it. That's much, much harder than just having an idea. Lots of folks have good ideas (or at least we think they're good, and statistically some of us are probably right), but very few have the opportunity, patience, skills, attitude, risk tolerance, etc to actually do it. So many things have to go right that it's a wonder any of us succeed at all.\n\nDon't change your life when you just have an idea. Turn it into a plan first. Do market research.

      "Something my team and I often see when companies bring projects to our group for funding is that each one, without fail, claims its project is \"revolutionary,\" \"a game changer,\" or \"disruptive,\" etc. - you get the point. To any project owner reading this post and comment, that language does not help at all. When you've seen thousands of pitch decks and business plans saying those same things, it becomes filler, useless, and the more we want to throw it away. Let the project speak for itself. If it's a world-changing project, trust me, the project owner won't need to say it; the clients, and especially the funding source, will. Even if they do say it is, take it with a grain of salt. \n\nWith that bit out of the way, the VCs who are saying the project could be worth a minimum of 8 figures sound like they're trying to get you hyped up about your project and dangling zeros in front of you to gain your interest. Whenever that happens, it's essential to stay grounded and not let the hype sway you. On the private funding side, the numbers mean nothing until the document giving you that money is signed, and even then, there's a waiting period of 5 business days for it to clear. We've had projects hit the billions and trillions for both worth and ask, and they all came crumbling in due diligence, so until the money is in your pocket, keep a level head.\n\nAs for your main question about staying or going, it might be important to weigh a few things. Do you have the team ready to begin the technical side of building the product/app/service/etc? Do you have the people lined up? Do you have any amount of money saved up for 6-12 months while things get to a point where you're able to bring in any money? Do you have enough money to pay for potential expenses for funding to get the millions you might need? Have you been able to create a business plan to flesh out the market, competition, use of funds, etc., yet? Did you get a CPA to check the financials? And those are only a few questions to ask to get started.\n\nIf you can comfortably answer those questions without hesitation in positive ways, then it would be leaning towards going. If you can't, then staying would be the way. If you're able to do both, potentially for a few years, stay at your job while getting the business up and running, that might also be a solution to examine. There will always be a tipping point, usually salary, sales, or some other metric, in running a business where it no longer makes sense for you to keep working your day job. What is that thing or amount for you? Until then, it becomes more of a \"what am I willing to sacrifice to make the project work?\"",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: I am 25, have >300k NW (80% S&P, 10% crypto, 10% cash) and no debt. I built & sold one computer repair business in the midwest USA a few years ago, because I strongly disliked the work & it was too rural to find employees. Currently, I have a stable remote job. With my spare time I run a stock analysis faceless youtube channel (but just for the last two months, with like 80 subs). I like stocks but i don't have a real personal story/huge 'expertise' I can sell in that field. My problem isn't a lack of ideas or work ethic, it's that I am having a hard time finding a niche that I really feel called to and can build a framework/movement around. I've read a lot of the fundamental books, but Expert secrets (brunson) made this indecision/passion problem the most clear to me. Like, the whole 'epiphany bridge' concept..having a very hard time finding any part of my story that I can leverage.\n\nMy past business: I've been a long-time lurker and have gotten immense value from this community! From 19-24 I built a local in-home computer repair/IT business from scratch. The final 2 years broke 100k/yr in revenue. Tons of on-the-ground sales experience. I sold the business (for \\~40k) because it was so rural and no one wanted to travel to the spot I was to service the (mostly aging) population. You'd think my framework here was computer repair but it was mostly computer repair\u00a0*with*\u00a0in-person youthful, cheerful customer service; I could not replicate this remotely. While it was not a fun 4-5 years, I think it was 100% worth it.\n\nCurrent job & skills: After a gap year of being a nomad, I became a fully remote project manager. I only took a small step back on income with 6-figure potential within 1-2 years, pretty good boss, some flexibility. I'm not desperately trying to escape it, but it's also not my calling. Between the two businesses I definitely have some level of skill in creating efficient systems, a bit of sales, a bit of IT work, and a level of self-discipline that is probably standard in this subreddit but a bit rarer for people my age on average. I am also very into personal development and have some advanced spreadsheet journals I've made that are really intriguing to whoever I show. I'm also passionate about geography & travel. If I had 10M in the bank right now, after of course setting up the portfolio, I would book flights & airbnb's every 3 months for a new city & explore the most remote parts of whatever region I were in, and after getting the hang of it take some of my friends (a few who rooted for me since day 1) on these trips for free. I'd probably try biohacking a bit & also try to help people organize their lives for success for free for a very few amount of people.\n\nSide-gig that I'm equally willing to double down on or throw away: For the past 2-3 months, in my spare time I've been doing a faceless YT channel doing stock analysis/commentary on WallStreetBets trades. Case studies, etc. Done weekly videos for 12 weeks now with like 80 subscribers. It is more enjoyable than my old computer repair gig and fully remote...but I feel more like a 'reporter' than an expert and struggle to see what my framework is here (I help X do Y via Z). I have doubts that I can successfully monetize this beyond AdSense (which is peanuts unless I get huge).\n\nMy problem: I have known for a while that the work I do lacks passion. I am obsessed with the idea of not just building a business, but finding a whole new opportunity and framework to teach that I am fired up about; also something that can be equally leveraged remotely as in-person. I'm not sure if there is some way to double down on that Youtube side gig that I'm missing, or pivot to something that I am an expert on and just not seeing, or go back to the drawing board to find what my true passion is. When I read Expert secrets (and a few other books, Zero to one, oversubscribed, etc.) I realized that I am not yet aware of what my life calling is and something that I can narrow in on and have tunnel vision with to service others, create value & get paid.\n\nConstraints in picking a niche: Only 2 I can think of. 1 is it has to have the option to be fully remote, like my job is now. Secondly, I don't want to go into a niche that requires me to plaster all over my socials from day 1, since that could have consequences in my day job. I'd rather be able to start faceless or at the very least not up front on my socials until I have some flight.\n\nI think the advice I'm asking for is, for those who\u00a0*have*\u00a0successfully built a brand in the way I'm describing, how did you do it, and based on the first impression you get from me, what do you think I should pursue? Am I overthinking this whole 'framework/movement' concept for my next business venture?",

      "You have to figure out what you're actually passionate about and can become an expert on before you take the plunge.\n\nI'd also reconsider your need to work remotely and pick a niche separate from your day job. You can just get a regular job in person and see it as an opportunity to learn. You will literally be getting paid to learn, and you have plenty of time to develop actual expertise and skills for a few years before starting a business."

    "selftext": "Doing my research it seems more like everything is AI this, AI that, and SaaS type offerings. And definitely focused on enterprise because you can get higher deals and easier funding. But what is the consensus anymore on hardware offerings that are b2b? My prototype is about 75% complete at this stage, but figuring out whether to chase any funding vs bootstrap is where I'm digging now. I've heard from people who say either 'a hardware solution like that would be attractive' or 'they won't want anything to do with hardware'.. So to get a variety of opinions, what are the thoughts here?\n\nI will not promote. ",

      "A lot of investors got rich in SaaS, so they never got immersed in the challenge that is manufacturing and supply chain.  So, they don't want to invest in businesses that rely upon it, because they don't have the connections and resources to get the business out of a jam.\n\nTo get a view on your personal direction, you need to determine what kind of investors you have in your network, and target at the most likely ones to take a meeting. If it's 90% SaaS exits, they probably won't want to touch hardware, or vice-versa.\n\n  \nDepending on your ability or desire to flex to investor direction - you could build both plans out, and see which sticks quicker.  But that's almost double the work.",
      "Hardware is by far the toughest to fundraise in and the most costly as well. However, if you secure some solid IP protections and find a unique manufacturing position, you can absolve investors of a lot of risk and make them thereby more willing to invest. Take a big look at your risk management strategy and next time you pitch, pitch from a risk strat perspective. \n\nAnother big part of the pitch should be about your manufacturing partners // business partners. An LOI from someone big in industry pushes a lot of buttons. No matter the case, you will be consistently undervalued when compared to AI / Saas startups, so get used to it",

One of the biggest problems is that the rulebooks for investing in hardware startups are not as well known or refined as for software. You can get a lot of investors trying to fit you into the wrong patterns, which usually means they will not invest.",

You need your ducks in a row, with no doubts about your ability to execute.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t just ask the internet if hardware is ok, you need to focus on what your ability to reach the right investors is. You should already be networking in their circles.\u00a0",
      "I started a hardware startup after college, so had no experience, we spent 2 years getting our product ready, and only fundraised after selling about 50k in product. \n\nWe ended up raising about 500k last year, which helped us start marketing and hire a few people. \n\nWe\u2019re now very profitable, mainly making sales through social media. \n\nWhat made it easy for us is selling a high ticket item (18k ea), with zero tooling investment, to an industrial market. \n\nHere\u2019s our instagram so you can see what we do. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cn_seamless?igsh=a2E1c2djOXVvNTBy&utm_source=qr",

With summer just around the corner, I\u2019m starting to wonder how much of an impact seasonality might have on growth especially in the early stages.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard and seen, things can slow down quite a bit during the summer months (especially July and August). People go on vacation, decision-makers become harder to reach, buying cycles stall, and overall engagement seems to drop until around September. Since I\u2019m still pre-launch, it\u2019s hard to know how much of that is hype vs. reality.\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve been running a SaaS (or launched one during the summer), I\u2019d love to hear about your experience. Did your MRR actually drop during the summer, or did you just see slower growth? Was it more about fewer signups, reduced user activity, or longer sales cycles?\n\nAnd more importantly if you have found a way to keep momentum going through the summer slump, what worked for you? Were there specific marketing campaigns, product launches, or community-building efforts that helped you stay top-of-mind? Did you lean into content, partnerships, or maybe even shift your strategy entirely during that time?\n\nAny insights, lessons, or advice would be super appreciated.
